            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Treatiſe I now Humbly offer to Your Lordſhip in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> has met with a very great and general Applauſe in <hi>French.</hi> A Second Edition of it was deſired in leſs than two Months after the firſt, and it is already Tranſlated into more Languages than one: But that which ought to weigh more than any other Commendation, is the high value Your Lordſhip ſets upon this Book; for if the moſt Accompliſhed Writers are the beſt Judges of other Mens Works, there lies no
<pb facs="tcp:96537:3"/>Appeal from Your Lordſhip's Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worth of this. I have heard Your Lordſhip deliver Your Opinion of this Performance in a very particular manner, and reckon it among the beſt Books that this Age has produced, and that in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, both for Piety and Learning, good Senſe and true Judgment.</p>
            <p>Your Lorſhip thought fit that ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Work ſhould be put into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> You were pleaſed, My Lord, to commit this Tranſlation to my care, and I could wiſh I had been as well qualified for that Office, as I was deſirous to diſcharge it to Your Lordſhip's Satisfaction. But I am Conſcious of my want of Abilities in this as well as in all other things, and I fear the Work of the Reverend and Worthy Author, who honours me with ſome ſhare in his Friendſhip, has loſt ſeveral Beauties and Graces by paſſing through my Hands. However, My Lord, I have rendred his Senſe as faithfully as I could, and that is all I would be accountable for to the Reader; for if among that Variety of nice and Tender Subjects which are touched here, the Author mixes any thing which does not ſuit with every Bodies Notions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is his Province and not mine to defend it. He lives in one of the remoteſt Countries in which the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:96537:3"/>is received, and in what he writes, he had his own Neighbourhood chiefly in View; ſo that his main deſign was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect things within his reach, to which the State of that Church, which is now in eminent danger, led him. But I leave to your Lordſhip to judge, whether that which he thought proper for his own Church, may not be likewiſe of good uſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And now my Lord, I do gladly embrace this opportunity to make a publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the extraordinary Obligations your Lordſhip has laid upon me. A Poſt in the ſervice of the Church is not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Favour I have received at your Hands: I reckon my ſelf much more beholden to your Lordſhip for the benefit of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Inſtructions, which I have enjoyed ſeveral Years in your Family. But here I muſt make a full ſtop, and how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am inclined to ſay a great deal upon the ſubject, yet I know your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip too well, to venture on it; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may think I know I muſt ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The beſt return I can make for the large experience I have had of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Kindneſs and Generoſity, is to put up my moſt hearty Prayers for the long
<pb facs="tcp:96537:4"/>Continuance of your Lordſhip's Life and Happineſs, and for the laſting Proſperity of your Family; this I do my Lord as truly as I profeſs my ſelf, with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſpect.</p>

            <head>THE Authors PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WE have reaſon to wonder at the great Corruptions that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are to be found among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The Religion they profeſs, does chiefly tend to Sanctify Men, and to Purge the World from Corruption and Vice; and one would think it ſhould produce that Effect, ſince it affords ſuch a clear Light, ſuch powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ſuch effectual Helps to Holineſs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, Whoever enquires into the Notions and Manners of Chriſtians, muſt have no great ſhare of Sincerity or Judgment; if he does not acknowledge, that Religion has but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til influence upon their Minds, and that there is an amazing Contradiction between their Lives and the Rules of Chriſtianity. This Corruption is ſo evident and ſo generally Confeſſed, that I need not ſtand to prove it.</p>
            <p>Taking it then for granted, that Chriſtians live in a great neglect of their Duties; It is natural to enquire into the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Corruption, and to conſider what Remedies ſhould be applied to it. This is what I intend to do in this Treatiſe, in hopes that ſuch an Enquiry will not be altogether unuſeful.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, it may Contribute to Maintain the
<pb facs="tcp:96537:5"/>Honour, and the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and to Confute Infidels and Libertines, who are apt to deſpiſe it, becauſe it's Precepts are little practiſed. If Religion, ſay they, be true and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, How comes it to paſs, that it has ſo little efficacy, and that there appears ſo much Diſorder, and Licentiouſneſs among the Profeſſors of it? To undeceive ſuch Men, and to infuſe into them a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſpect for Religion, it is of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to diſcover the Cauſes of the Decay of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and to ſhew that if Men are Corrupted, it is not becauſe Chriſt's Religion is inſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Vertue and Order into the World; But that this Evil flows from ſome other Cauſe, and that if Chriſtians did what they might and ought to do, true Piety would not be ſo uncommon as it is amongſt them.</p>
            <p>A Second Advantage which may be reaped from this Enquiry; is this, it will appear by it, that how great ſoever the Corruption may be; It is not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as many imagine, paſt remedy. Which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is a moſt dangerous Prejudice, while Men look on it as impoſſible to ſtem the Tide of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to re-eſtabliſh Order and Purity of Manners in the World, they do not ſo much as attempt it, they let things go on at the ſame rate; and ſo the Diſorder increaſes and ſpreads farther. It cannot be denied, but that we Corruption is great, general and inveterate; but God forbid, we ſhould look upon it as an incurable Diſeaſe. The Fountains of it may eaſily be diſcovered; and it is not impoſſible to ſtop them. I hope this
<pb facs="tcp:96537:5"/>will be acknowledged by thoſe, who ſhall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and without prepoſſeſſion conſider, what is propoſed in this Work.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is no means more likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Corruption, than to cut off the Occaſions of it: That is the ſureſt as well as the moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Method. One of the main Reaſons, why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Books deſigned to inſpire Men with a love of Religion and Piety, have not all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that might be expected from them; is, that the Authors do not ſufficiently obſerve the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes of the Depravation of Manners. It is to little purpoſe to deplore the Corruption of the Age, to exhort Men, and to give them fine Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Morality: The Work of Reformation cannot be much advanced, as long as the Evil is not taken in its Cauſe, and as long as ſuch Principles and Abuſes continue among Chriſtians, as are, and will always be, Obſtacles to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I conſidered that this Matter had not yet been thoroughly handled by any Author, at leaſt that I know of. Of thoſe who have touched upon it in their Books; ſome have confined themſelves to Conſiderations purely Moral, and others to Theological Reflections, upon the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which are in Vogue, or upon the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which divide Chriſtians; but they have omitted many things which ſeem eſſential; no doubt, becauſe they did not intend to treat this Subject purpoſely, or becauſe they did not take a View of the whole extent of it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96537:6"/>
            <p>As theſe Conſiderations have made me wiſh for a long while that among ſo many able Men who write about Religion, ſome might undertake ſo important a Subject; ſo they have determined me to Publiſh theſe Eſſays upon the Cauſes of Corruption; hoping that others will apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the full Diſcuſſion of thoſe Matters, which are here but imperfectly hinted at.</p>
            <p>But that the Scope of this Treatiſe may be the better underſtood; and that no body may expect that in it, which according to the Scheme I formed to my ſelf, ought not to have a place here; I ſhall acquaint the Reader with one thing, which he may perhaps have foreſeen, from what has been already ſaid.</p>
            <p>I do not propoſe to my ſelf to handle this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the way of the Divinity Schools. No Man therefore ought to wonder, if I ſay nothing of the State in which all Men are born; nor of that Inclination to Vice which is obſerved in them. For tho' this is the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Corruption; yet certainly this Corruption would be much leſs, if Chriſtians did uſe the means which God affords them, to overcome it; and if there were not other Sources which feed and ſtrengthen that vitious Propenſity. Beſides, I do not conſider Corruption in general, as it is Common to all Mankind, but I enquire into the Cauſes of the Corruption of Chriſtians in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Neither do I deſign to write a Moral Treatiſe; ſo that it muſt not be expected, that I ſhould diſcourſe of Self-Love and Pride, and
<pb facs="tcp:96537:6"/>of all the other Paſſions, which are the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions of Mens Sins; or that I ſhould trace out all the particular Cauſes of every Sin. This would carry me too far; and ſuch things have been often examined. I therefore apply my ſelf only to the general <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and I manage the the Matter thus.</p>
            <p>I divide this Work into Two Parts, becauſe the Cauſes of Corruption may be of Two ſorts. I ſhall call thoſe of the firſt ſort, Particular or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; becauſe they are within us, and to be found in every particular Man that lives ill. Thoſe of the Second ſort, which are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I name External, becauſe they proceed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from certain outward Circumſtances, and from the unhappineſs of the Times; than from the fault of particular Perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> I ſhall treat of in the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> are no other, but the ill Diſpoſitions in which moſt Chriſtians are, and which hinder their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to Piety: And of theſe I ſhall obſerve Nine.</p>

                  <p>WHEN a Man thinks of the Cauſes of that Corruption which over-runs the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World; the firſt which offers it ſelf to his mind, is Ignorance, and therefore I ſhall begin with it.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96537:8"/>
                  <p>Our Notions and Knowledge, are the firſt Principles of our Actions. We can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love a Thing, or adhere to it, when it is not at all, or when it is but imperfectly known to us: Suppoſing then that Men are Ignorant, or very little Inſtructed in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, there is no wonder that they ſhould be Corrupt; for they muſt of neceſſity be ſo. On the other hand, when they appear to be extreamly Corrupt, we may conclude that they want Inſtruction. I do not deny, but that Corruption proceeds ſometimes from the wickedneſs of the Heart, which reſiſts the Light of the Underſtanding; and that Men frequently Act againſt their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But it may ſafely be ſaid, That if Chriſtians were well Inſtructed, they would not be ſo Corrupt, and that wherever an extraordinary Corruption is viſible, there is likewiſe a great deal of Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>This is confirm'd by the Scripture, and by God's Conduct in the Eſtabliſhing the Chriſtian Religion. When the Apoſtles ſpeak of thoſe Diſorders, wherein the Heathens lived before their Converſion, they aſcribe them to the darkneſs of their Minds.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. IV. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>have their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding darkened, being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Life of God through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96537:8"/>that is in them, becauſe of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Heart.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle calls the Times which preceded the Coming of of Chriſt, <hi>the Times of Ignorance.</hi> And the firſt Thing which God did to change the Face of the World, and to reſcue it from Corruption; was to diſpel the Clouds of their Ignorance, and to enlighten them, with the Knowledge of himſelf, by the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Although Chriſtians cannot be charged with ſo groſs an Ignorance as that of the Heathens; yet they fall very ſhort of that Knowledge they ought to have, and it muſt be confeſſed, that for the moſt part, they live in ſhameful and deplorable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. This is the Reaſon why Piety is ſo much wanting among them, and why they are ſo Depraved and Vicious; which is the Thing I will endeavour to make appear.</p>
                  <p>In order to this; As the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be reduced to theſe Two Heads,

                  </p>
                  <p>It is fit to Enquire, whether with reſpect to theſe, Chriſtians are furniſhed with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Information? I ſhall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they are very little Inſtructed.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In that which concerns the Truths of Religion. And</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96537:9"/>
                  <p n="2">II. In what relates to Manners, and to the Duties, of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The Reflections I ſhall beſtow upon both theſe Heads; will I hope, clearly prove, That among thoſe vaſt multitudes of Men, who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, there are very few, who are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Religion. From whence it will be Natural to Conclude, That they muſt needs be very Corrupt.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. To begin with the Knowledge of the Truths of Chriſtianity; we muſt diſtinguiſh Two ſorts of Truths in Religion: The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Particular Truths. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Truths, are thoſe, upon which the whole of Religion is founded; ſuch as theſe, That there is a God, That the Bible is a Divine Book, And that the Chriſtian Religion is True. By Particular Truths, I mean the various Doctrines which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contains, and which are the Parts of it; but which at the ſame time, depend upon the General Truths, as upon their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Doctrine of the Sacraments, of Juſtification, and many others, are of this Number. Now let us conſider the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſtians in reference to theſe Two ſorts of Truths.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Every Man who makes uſe of his Reaſon, may eaſily apprehend, That the General Truths are the moſt important;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96537:9"/>that they are thoſe of which one ought chiefly to be perſuaded; and that without theſe General Truths, the Particular ones would be uſeleſs, nay, would not be ſo much as Truths. To Enquire, Whether there be any Sacraments, or how a Man can be Juſtified; one muſt believe firſt, That there is a God and a Religion: For if I am not convinc'd of the Exiſtence of God, and of the Truth of Religion, it would ſignifie little to me, whether or not there were any Sacraments, and all the time I ſhould employ in the proſecution of this Enquiry, would be loſt.</p>
                  <p>This firſt Reflection does already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us an Eſſential and Capital Defect. A great many Chriſtians want Inſtruction concerning the Principles and Foundations of Chriſtianity; they do not ſufficiently conſider the Certainty and Importance of it. Their Knowledge of Religion, does ſeldom go further than the Particular Truths of it, and does not reach the General. This is ſo common a Fault, that it may be obſerved even in thoſe whole Profeſſion it is to Study Religion and to Teach it to others. Some have ſpent the beſt part of their Lives, in the Study of Divinity, or in Expounding the Scripture, who never ſeriouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Arguments for the Truth of Chriſtianity, or the Divinity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96537:10"/>Some are Maſters of the principal Controverſies which divide Chriſtians, who would ſtand mute if they were called back to the firſt Elements of Religion, and if they were to maintain againſt an Infidel, that there is a Religion, or that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is true. The People enter yet leſs than the Divines into the Examination of the general Truths; and there are very few who either attend to them, or indeed believe them as they ought.</p>
                  <p>And yet the Whole of Religion depends upon a firm Perſuaſion concerning the Principles of Faith; it is that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the particular Truths effectual to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and which begets Piety and the Love of Virtue. When a Man is perſuaded that Religion propoſes nothing but what is certain, he immediately receives with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence whatſoever it teaches; he feels an Inclination in himſelf to obſerve its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and he believes a Judgment and another Life, as if he ſaw them before his Eyes. Such is the Efficacy of a true Faith, and of a ſteady Perſuaſion about funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths. But without this Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it is very hard, not to ſay impoſſible, to adhere ſincerely to Religion, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duties of it. And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Source of the Corruption of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96537:10"/>
                  <p>It may perhaps be objected, that all Chriſtians receive the general Truths of their Creeds, and that theſe are not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned but by Pagans and Atheiſts. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I ſhall make two Reflections,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is but too true, that in the Point of Religion, there is at this Day a great Number of Perſons who entertain very looſe Opinions and that do at leaſt border upon Atheiſm. Theſe pernicious Tenets are ſpread wider than ſome People think. Not only the Libertines are infected with them, but even the Common People. All the profane Men and Deiſts are not to be found at Courts, in Armies, or among the Learned; there are ſome in Towns, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Vulgar, and even among Country Clowns. If we examine a little the Diſcourſes and Apprehenſions of Men, eſpecially of thoſe whoſe Life is irregular, if we do but begin to reaſon with them and preſs them, we may ſoon perceive the Principles of Incredulity and Atheiſm in many of them. It will be found that they are not thoroughly perſuaded that there is a God, and another Life; or that if they do not proceed to that degree of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety which attacks directly the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Religion, they harbour at leaſt this Fancy, that God doth not narrowly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96537:11"/>obſerve Mens Deportment; that he will not be ſo ſevere as to damn them for ſome Sins they have committed, and that there is not ſuch great Harm in gratifying ones Paſſions, and living at the uſual rate of the World. Theſe and the like Sentiments are general enough, and yet they lead the ſtraight way to Deiſm, and tend plainly to the Subverſion of Religion. It would be therefore highly neceſſary, in order to root out ſuch dangerous Errours, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to eſtabliſh theſe great Truths; that there is a God, that this God ſpeaks to us in his Word, and that whatever the Goſpel tells us of another Life, is moſt certain. This I ſay would be altogether needful, if it were but for the Inſtruction of thoſe I have now mentioned, and their Number is greater than is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> We may take notice, that tho' Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians profeſs to believe the Truths of their Religion, yet that Belief is not lively and ſtrong enough in them all. It is beyond all queſtion, that moſt Chriſtians are ſo only becauſe they were engaged by their Birth in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; but that after all, they know very little of the Truth and Divinity of it. They would in like manner have been Jews or Pagans, if they had been born in Judaiſm
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96537:11"/>or Paganiſm; ſo that properly ſpeaking they cannot be ſaid to have Faith; for Faith is a Perſuaſion; to believe, is to be perſuaded; and it is impoſſible to believe a thing right without Reaſon or Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which is called Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly nothing elſe but a confuſed and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion, which makes but very ſlight Impreſſions upon the Heart and Mind; but true Faith is a greater Rarity among Chriſtians than we are aware of. Now as Faith is the only Principle of Piety, ſo a bad Life does chiefly ſpring from Want of Faith and from Incredulity. And there are two ſorts of Infidels; ſome deny and reject Divine Truths; others do not quite deny them, but they doubt and believe but weakly. The Infidels who deny the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, are not many, but the Number of thoſe who doubt, and are not well perſuaded, is very great.</p>
                  <p>This diſcovers to us the Reaſon why Men who are acquainted with the Divine Truths and profeſs to believe them, do yet act quite contrary to the Dictates of Faith and Religion. There ſeems to be in their Proceeding a manifeſt Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: It is a thing wondered at; that People who believe a God, and a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhould live as if there was neither God nor Religion; upon this we are apt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96537:12"/>to ſay, that Sinners are not conſiſtent with themſelves; and as if it were impoſſible to reconcile their Practice with their Belief, we cry out, that the depth of Man's Heart is unſearchable. But there is no ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Caſe, and the proceeding of bad Chriſtians, is not always ſo contradictory, as it ſeems to be. I confeſs that Men Sin ſometimes againſt the Convictions of their own Conſciences, and that ſome who want not Knowledge, do yet Live very Ill.</p>
                  <p>This may proceed from Inconſideration, from the violence of their Paſſions, from too great a regard to their Temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, from the flattering hope of Pardon, or ſome ſuch Principle. But for the moſt part, Men act conſonantly and ſuitably to their Belief, and it is but ſeldom, that in the Conduct of their Lives, they behave themſelves contrary to the Sentiments and Principles that poſſeſs them. We ſuppoſe that bad Chriſtians believe the Truths of Religion, and in that we are miſtaken. Many of them want Faith, and are not fully convinced of thoſe Truths. Is it to be imagined, that ſo many Perſons who live in Sin, who make Conſcience of nothing, and who violate every minute the Rules of their Duty; ſhould be thoroughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that there is a God who ſees them, and to whom they are to give an Account?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96537:12"/>From all this I Conclude, That the Ignorance of the General Truths of Religion, is one of the principal ſources of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>Some will ſay, That theſe Truths need not be proved, and that they are of the number of thoſe firſt Principles, which are taken for granted, becauſe they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the Hearts of all Men. But this Objection is eaſily anſwered by what has been ſaid juſt now. I own that the Ideas and Principles of Religion, carry in them a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Evidence, inaſmuch as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from Reaſon and Conſcience; and becauſe there are Principles in Men by the help of which, they may arrive at the Knowledge of the Truths of Religion. But theſe Principles and Ideas have been in ſome meaſure ſtifled in many, either thro' ill Education, or worldly Buſineſs, or Vice, or ſome other Cauſe; ſo that they feel the force and evidence of them but imperfectly; and ſome have no ſenſe at all of them. Upon this Account it is neceſſary to excite and enlighten thoſe Ideas, to explain and eſtabliſh thoſe Principles. I acknowledge further, That ſome parts of thoſe Proofs upon which Religion is built, lie open to all Mens Eyes; but yet the Ignorant, and thoſe who are taken up with other Objects, do not obſerve them: They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be made to attend to them; juſt as we

However the Opinion of thoſe who pretend that the General Truths ought not to be proved, is contrary to the Holy Scripture; which teaches us to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the Principles of Religion, and to ſearch into the Proofs of them; where in order to Convince Men that there is an Almighty and Infinitely Good God, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to them, the Beauties and Wonders which ſhine in his Works, and exhorts them to the Conſideration of them. This may be ſeen in the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> In the XIX. and CIV. <hi>Pſal. Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. and in many other Places.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> It may further be ſaid, That the Proof of General Truths, is too difficult for the Common People, and that the Learned only are capable of ſuch a Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I grant that all ſorts of Perſons are not able to comprehend all that has been Writ upon theſe Matters. And therefore I do not pretend, that it is impoſſible to have a true Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without entring into the Detail of all theſe Proofs, and without following with the utmoſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all the deep and abſtracted Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which have been uſed to prove the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96537:14"/>Exiſtence of God, or the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. I think rather thoſe Matters ought to be treated with great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, eſpecially in Sermons. It would be a great piece of Imprudence, to muſter up in a Publick Diſcourſe, all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Atheiſts, or the Subtilties of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; theſe ought to be referred to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conferences. Thoſe who ſpeak to the People, muſt take heed, leſt by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Speculating too much, they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fundamental Truths Problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and raiſe Scruples in Mens minds. They ought to build upon this Principle, That Men are carried by a Common and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination to believe the Exiſtence of God, to acknowledge a difference betwixt Good and Evil, and to own Providence, and the other Truths of Religion; but for all that, it may be very uſeful and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to confirm thoſe Truths, to ſet them in the cleareſt Light, and to Convince the People of them.</p>
                  <p>As to what is ſaid, That the Proofs of the Principles of Religion are not ſuitable to the Peoples Capacity: I anſwer, That moſt of thoſe Proofs are ſuch, that there is no need of being either Learned, or a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, to be affected with them. We ought to ſuppoſe here, that the more important any Truth is, the clearer and the eaſier
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96537:15"/>the Proofs of it are. I do not ſpeak of all Truths; there are ſome that are moſt certain, whoſe Proofs are difficult, and above the reach of common Underſtandings; ſuch are many Metaphyſical Truths, and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Demonſtrations; but at the ſame time, the knowledge of thoſe Truths is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and a Man without danger may be ignorant of them. I ſpeak now only of thoſe Truths which it concerns every Perſon to know, and which are of general uſefulneſs and neceſſity. Theſe are always clear and eaſily proved. And this, by the by, ought on the one hand, to make us admire the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, who has ſo well provided for the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men; and on the other hand to ſet Bounds to our Curioſity, and to fortify our Faith againſt thoſe Doubts, which might ſtart up in our Minds, by reaſon of ſo many things which we are ignorant of.</p>
                  <p>As therefore of all Truths, none are of greater Conſequence, or of a more intire certainty than thoſe, which Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon; ſo the Proof of thoſe Truths ought to be ſimple, evident and ſuited to all Mens capacity. Thus when in order to prove the Being of a God; we alledge, for inſtance, the State and Order in which the World ſubſiſts; when we ſhew that

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96537:16"/>but what perfectly agrees with ſound Reaſon, and the Sentiments of our own Conſciences; and nothing but what is advantagious to particular Perſons, and to Societies: When I ſay, we urge theſe Proofs and others like them, and have the Art of propoſing them in a clear and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Method, it is certain that they contain nothing that is very difficult. Theſe are the cleareſt and the ſtrongeſt Proofs that can be uſed, in a Subject of this Nature; and the Arguments which are made uſe of to eſtabliſh theſe Proofs, are for the moſt part ſo natural, and ſo conform to the Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of our Minds, and to the Principles of Common Senſe, that there are few even of the Vulgar who may not apprehend them; if not perfectly and in their whole extent, which is reſerved to Men of a larger Capacity; yet ſo far at leaſt as ſufficiently to be ſenſible of their Force.</p>
                  <p>If then Difficulties and Obſcurities are to be met with in the Diſcuſſion of the Principles of Religion; it is becauſe this Matter is neglected, and the People are little Informed. But if the ſame Care had been taken to Inſtruct Chriſtians in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of Religion, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Explaining and Clearing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ones; they would have another kind of perſuaſion than they have of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96537:16"/>Truth of their Religion. Theſe great and ſublime Truths, have without compariſon more ſuitableneſs and affinity with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Men and the Sentiments of their Hearts, than many obſcure, difficult and leſs neceſſary things, which yet have been effectually taught them.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4ly,</hi> But againſt this, Experience may poſſibly be Objected: It may be ſaid, that there are Chriſtians, who moſt certainly have Piety, and yet did never meditate much upon the Foundations of Chriſtianity. I. Anſwer, That it is not conceivable, how a Man ſhould be a pious Chriſtian, without being perſuaded of the Truth of his Religion. For at this rate, Piety would be but mere Conceit and Enthuſiaſm; and we muſt ſay not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that Scripture and Reaſon tell us to the contrary, that Men are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians without Knowledge or Reaſon. It cannot be otherwiſe, but that good Men muſt have been convinced, of the Truths of the Goſpel, and have had a lively ſenſe, that theſe are the moſt certain and the moſt important of all Truths. If we enquire what Principle it is, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Piety in the Hearts of the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple People, we ſhall find it is an unmova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſuaſion, that there is a God, a Judgment, a Heaven and a Hell; which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96537:17"/>Perſuaſion is neceſſarily founded upon ſome of the Proofs I have hinted at.</p>
                  <p>I grant, which no doubt will be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to me, that in many this Perſuaſion is not clear enough, and that it is not the reſult of a particular examination; but this does not leſſen the force of my Argument. For though the Perſuaſion of Good Men ſhould not be ſo clear and ſo well grounded as it might be, yet it does not follow but that it is ſincere; a Man may be convinced of a Truth, tho' he does not diſcover all the certainty and all the Proofs of it, and tho' he is not able to anſwer all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it. So that ſtill it is true that there is no Religion, without the belief of the General Truths of it. After all we muſt acknowledge, that there are Good Men, who are not ſo well inſtructed upon this Head as it were to be wiſhed. And this defect of Inſtruction, this imperfection of their Faith, is one of the main Cauſes of the defects and imperfections of their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Thus we may frequently obſerve in their Conduct, ſuch Weakneſſes and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as do not agree with the pure Light of Faith, and with the exactneſs of the Rules of the Goſpel. This is part of the Unhappineſs we lament, and of that Corruption of which we ſeek the Cauſes. But no Man will diſpute, but that if the ſame Perſons had more inſtruction, they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96537:17"/>would carry Virtue much farther than they do. The degree of Piety, does or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily follow the degree of Faith: Where there is no Faith, there is no Piety; and where Faith is weak and faint, Piety is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Very few Perſons diſtinguiſh between the more and the leſs neceſſary Things, between the moſt uſeful Subjects and thoſe which are of little Edification. Moſt Men ſtudy Religion without Rule, and to no purpoſe, and ſo run out upon many unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Subjects. That which is called Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Divinity or Knowledge of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; is frequently nothing elſe, but a heap of Notions, which have no influence upon Piety, or reſpect to Mens Salvation. It is but a confuſed Medley, wherein the leaſt neceſſary Things, are blended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out choice and diſtinction, with the moſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96537:19"/>important. I do not ſpeak here of the perplext and unaccurate Ideas, which Men often have about theſe Matters; I paſs by the falſe Reaſonings, which are ſometimes uſed to eſtabliſh the Truths of Chriſtianity, as well as thoſe Miſts, which the School-Divinity has caſt upon the Goſpel: I do only obſerve, That the Knowledge which moſt Men have of Religion, is not very fit to make them ſenſible of the Beauties of it; ſo that when all is done, it is no wonder that it ſhould ſeem to many an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, crabbed, unpleaſant and intricate Science, and that it ſhould have ſo little Effect upon Mens Minds.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> The other Fault is, that Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with bare Inſtruction, or with the ſimple Knowledge of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truths, while they are ignorant of their uſe. If they do but know in an Hiſtorical manner, what is believed by Chriſtians, and are able to reaſon about it, and to diſcern Truth from Error, they think themſelves ſufficiently inſtructed. But theſe Inſtructions do not reach the Heart. Among that ſmall number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſome Knowledge, there are but few who conſider that this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is to be directed to a Holy Life, as to its proper end and intendment; and they are fewer yet who actually direct it to that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96537:19"/>end, and make it ſubſervient to the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Lives. And ſo it comes to paſs, that a great many of thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the Truths of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have yet but an imperfect and barren Knowledge of it, and that with all their Attainments, they live ſtill in the darkneſs of Corruption and Vice.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Hitherto we have conſidered Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with relation to the Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which the Chriſtian Faith embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Let us now view this Ignorance with reſpect to the Duties which Chriſtianity preſcribes. Upon this ſecond Head we ſhall diſcover yet a greater Ignorance than upon the firſt. For after all ſomething may be done, when we are only to infuſe into Men ſome Knowledge of Truths and Doctrines. It is uſual enough to ſee very ill Men, who in this regard are not deſtitute of Light. But it is much harder to inſtruct them in the Duties of Holineſs. We may apply here theſe Words of our Saviour's;<note n="*" place="bottom">John III. 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Men love Darkneſs rather than Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Deeds are evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> The Maxims of the Goſpel and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96537:20"/>the Rules of its Morality condemn Sinners, and therefore they do not care to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about them. Thoſe who love the World and their Sins, are glad if they can enjoy the Sweets of theſe without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and Interruption: And therefore they will not enquire much into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt; they are loth to come at ſuch a Knowledge as would diſcloſe to them the Turpitude of Vice, and breed Diſquiet and Remorſe in them. Ignorance begets Security: The more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant a Man is, the fewer Stings he feels in his Conſcience, and the more Pleaſure he takes in his Sin. The very ſhadow of Evil frights a well-inſtructed Chriſtian; but Crime it ſelf does not daunt one who is ignorant: He does not hear within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe Alarms or Reproaches, which are either the Preſervatives againſt Sin, or the Remedies of it.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96537:20"/>does not know them, or does not think them neceſſary: This is the plain Reaſon why Men do ſo little addict themſelves to Piety; they know neither its Neceſſity nor its Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As the Foundation of Faith is the Belief of the Truth and certainty of thoſe Facts and Doctrines which Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; ſo the Ground-work of Piety is, to be perſuaded of the Neceſſity of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which Chriſtianity requires: Without this Perſuaſion, it is impoſſible for Men to reſign up themſelves to the Practice of Virtue. Now one would think that all Chriſtians ſhould be fully convinced of this Neceſſity. For if there is any certain Truth in Chriſtianity, it is this, That the Practice of good Works is Neceſſary. Good Works do ſo immediately belong to the Deſign and the Eſſence of Religion, that it falls to the Ground as ſoon as they are taken away: And in Proportion as the Neceſſity of a good Life is weakned, ſo much is the Power and Beauty of that Holy Religion which Chriſt brought into the World, leſſened. Religion contains Doctrines, Precepts, Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. It does altogether depend upon the Exiſtence of a God, and the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another Life, and a Judgment to come. But if you baniſh out of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96537:21"/>the abſolute Neceſſity of good Works, you attack it in all its Parts, and you undermine its very Foundations. For this makes the Knowledge of its Doctrines vain and needleſs; it turns its Precepts into bare Counſels; the Promiſes of it, which are conditional, and ſuppoſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ceaſe to be Promiſes; the Threats which God denounces againſt Sinners, are but empty Menaces, which God makes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fright Men, but does not intend to execute. This deſtroys the chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt Proofs of the Exiſtence of a God, and of another Life; it ruines that great Argument for Religion, which is drawn from the Difference between Virtue and Vice, and from the Deſerts of both; and it contradicts the Neceſſity, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Juſtice of the laſt Judgment. All this may eaſily be demonſtrated. This Neceſſity of good Works might likewiſe be proved, from the plain Declarations of the Word of God; and it might be ſhewen, that there is no Truth more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently inculcated than this in Holy Writ. But not to engage in theſe Particulars, which do not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to my Purpoſe; I ſhall take it for granted that a Holy Life is abſolutely neceſſary; for either that is true, or there is nothing true in Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:96537:21"/>
                  <p>Yet how clear ſoever this truth may be, it is but little known, and Men are not much perſuaded of it. No Man indeed does flatly and without ſome Preamble deny the Neceſſity of Holineſs; every Teacher profeſſes that to be his Doctrine; all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in Shew at leaſt, are agreed about it. But when they come to explain their Meaning clearly concerning this Neceſſity; when it comes to the Application or to Practice, or when they eſtabliſh other Doctrines, they contradict themſelves, they heſitate upon the Matter, or they explain it with certain Reſtrictions, which ſooth Men in Security, and diſpoſe them to believe that Salvation may be obtained without good Works; which overthrows their Neceſſity. Nay, ſome frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch a Notion of Religion as even excludes Good Works; this will appear in the following Chapters.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that though this intire and indiſpenſable Neceſſity of a good Life were not ſuppoſed, yet this would not preſently open a Door to Licentiouſneſs, ſince there remain other ſufficient Motives to Holineſs, ſuch as thoſe which are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of the Divine Laws, from the Gratitude and Love we owe to God, from the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96537:22"/>of our Neighbour, and from our Calling and Duty. I anſwer, that theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are very juſt and preſſing, and that they neceſſarily enter into that Obedience, which all true Chriſtians pay to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. I acknowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that they would be ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire all men with the Love of Virtue, if they did all govern themſelves by the Principles of right Reaſon and Juſtice. But theſe are not the only Motives which ought to be urged; God propoſes others beſides; he promiſes, he threatens, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. XII. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee his face,</hi> which imports an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. And ſurely as Men generally are, there are many of them upon whom thoſe Motives taken from Decency, Juſtice, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Duty, or the Edification of our Neighbours, will have very litte Force. The moſt Honourable Motives are not always the moſt effectual. Man being ſo Corrupt, is ſo many ways, and by ſo ſtrong a Biaſs carried towards evil, that it is hard for him, without an abſolute neceſſity, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from it. But how much leſs will he refrain from ſin; if he is perſuaded that it is not neceſſary to controul his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to confine himſelf to a kind of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96537:22"/>Life, which appears unpleaſant and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to him? Now as this is the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in which moſt People are, we need no longer wonder, why there is ſo little Religion and Piety among Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it is difficult to practiſe thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we do not think neceſſary, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they croſs our Inclinations; it is yet harder to practiſe them, when we do not know them. It is not poſſible to do good or to avoid evil, if we do not know, the good that we ſhould do, and the evil we ought to ſhun. Now in this the generality of Chriſtians want inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Every body ſpeaks of Piety and Virtue, but few Men know what they are. The Common People are little acquainted with the Duties of Religion or the Rules of Chriſtian Morals. This muſt be confeſt, and the Glory of God requires, that we ſhould ingenuouſly own it. I cannot but enter here into ſome Particulars, to prove this Ignorance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome eſſential Duties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to a great number of Chriſtians, and which were never thought of by an infinity of Men. I will alledge for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one of the plaineſt and of the moſt neceſſary Duties of Morality, and that is Reſtitution. Tho' the Scripture ſhould not expreſly enjoyn it, we need but conſult
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96537:23"/>Reaſon and natural Juſtice, to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he who has done an injury to another Man by taking from him any part of his Property; is bound to make up that damage, by reſtoring to him whatever he has wronged him of. There is every day occaſion enough to make Reſtitution, nothing being more common, than for one Man to appropriate to himſelf by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means, what belongs to another; and yet in many places Reſtitution is a thing without Preſident. But this we ought not to wonder at, conſidering that there are Thouſands of Chriſtians who never heard a word of this Duty. This Matter is ſo little known, and the People are ſo little inſtructed about it; that a Treatiſe concerning Reſtitution, written by Mr. <hi>la Placette,</hi> having been publiſhed ſome Years ſince; it has been read as a very ſingular Book, the Subject whereof was new and curious. Nay ſome have gone ſo far as to cenſure this Doctrine of Reſtitution, pretending that it was novel and too ſevere; ſuch a pitch of Ignorance are Men arrived at in Matters of Morality. And this is not the only Duty which is not underſtood; there are many others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, either among thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Men, or among thoſe which are particular to every Calling, and which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96537:23"/>it does not appear that Men were ever taught or ever made the leaſt Reflection upon. Now a Man muſt needs neglect the Duties that he does not know.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are divers Sins, which are not commonly ranked among Sins, or which Men do not think to be Damning Sins. Of this number is Lying and unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, either in Diſcourſe or in Dealings. Among theſe we may alſo reckon, Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Sloth, a Soft and Voluptuous Life; Many indirect Practices to grow Rich, which are eſtabliſhed and authorized by Cuſtom; Drunkenneſs, which in ſome Countries is not eſteemed a Vice, and all thoſe Sins which are only committed by our Thoughts. Chriſtians now a-days think themſelves innocent, ſo they do not do things manifeſtly Criminal. They conceive that Murther is a Crime, but they do not think themſelves guilty for paſſing a raſh judgment upon their Neighbours, or taking up unjuſt ſuſpicions of them. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Uncleanneſs to be a Sin, tho' even ſome are very indulgent to themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head; but impure Thoughts or Senſuality go for nothing with them. Thus there are many Sins which Men are not inſtructed about, and what wonder is it then, if they commit them without ſcruple, and if there is ſo much Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Manners?</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96537:24"/>
                  <p n="3">3. There are ſome general Maxims in Morality without the Knowledge of which, it is impoſſible to have a ſolid Piety; and yet theſe are almoſt univerſally unknown; eſpecially theſe Two, which deſcribe to us the Characters of true Holineſs. The firſt is; That a Habit of Sin is an infallible token of a Corrupt Man; and that any one habitual Sin which a Man does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, eſpecially when he is warned of it, is enough to ſhut him out of Heaven. This Maxim is underſtood but by very few People. Moſt Men are ingaged in vitious Habits; ſuch as Praying without Attention, Swearing, falling into a Paſſion, or the like: Theſe Habits grow ſtronger with Age, Men live and die in them, and yet they think, they die in a State of Salvation. The other Maxim which is neither leſs important nor better known; is that there is a vaſt difference, between Sin and Sin, and between Sinners and Sinners; that the Frailties of Good Men are one thing, and the great and wilful Sins of bad Men, another thing. If Men do not apprehend this difference, they will confound Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with Vice, and good Men with impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wretches; and yet this is little obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is commonly believed that all Men being Sinners, they are all upon the matter in the ſame condition, and do ſin all alike,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96537:24"/>ſo that there is no great odds between them. Such Notions muſt needs make way for Libertiniſm.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4ly,</hi> If Chriſtians have ſome Knowledge concerning the Duties of Morality; yet that Knowledge is too general and ſuperficial. They know perhaps in the main, that ſome Sins are to be avoided, and ſome Virtues to be practiſed; but that, they only know confuſedly, they content themſelves with ſome general Ideas, which for the moſt part prove uſeleſs and inſignificant. The deſign of Morality, is to regulate Mens Actions, in all the Circumſtances they may be in, and to teach them how they ought to behave themſelves, in all the different Caſes and Emergencies of Life. Now as theſe Caſes and Circumſtances are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various, it is neceſſary that Men ſhould know their Duty with ſome exactneſs, and that they ſhould have Rules at hand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all particular Caſes, by the help of which they may diſcern, what is lawful from what is not. For here ſuperficial Knowledge and general Ideas, will not ſerve the turn; becauſe they do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine particular Caſes.</p>
                  <p>The Principles of Morality are clear, but it is requiſite to make a juſt application of them, and to draw right Conſequences from them. Every body acknowledges,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96537:25"/>that Wrong is not to be done to any Man, but few know what the doing of wrong is. There are innumerable ways of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Juſtice in relation to our Neighbours, or of getting Money, which are ſinful; and yet theſe are made uſe of every day, and People think there is no harm in them; and ſo they are guilty of Cheating, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Injuſtice, and they do not know it. Whence does this proceed but from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or from thoſe general and ſuperficial Notions which I have mentioned? This is one of the Reaſons why ſome Books and Diſcourſes of Piety produce ſo little effect, they handle things only in the lump; they treat of Virtues and Vices, of Temperance, of Covetouſneſs and Injuſtice; they exhort and threaten; but they uſually go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Generalities, and they ſeldom deſcend to thoſe Particulars, which are ſo neceſſary to inform and direct the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5ly,</hi> Men are no leſs Ignorant concerning the Degrees, than they are concerning the Parts of Holineſs. Chriſtians are not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Practice of many Virtues; but they ought beſides that to practiſe them in the moſt perfect manner. Our Saviour does not require in his Diſciples a mean and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary degree of Holineſs; but he calls them to Perfection. He demands that they ſhould

There are many who boldly rank themſelves among Good Men; and yet are not able to give a ſolid reaſon of that Opinion they have conceived of their own Probity and Virtue; Nay they are perhaps actually engaged in Vice and Impiety. If they are but free from noiſy and ſcandalous Sins, if they feel now and then ſome good Motions, if they have ſome good Qualities, or an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome Virtues, or an abhorrence of ſome Vices; that is enough to fill them with a good opinion of themſelves.

                  <p>It muſt not be ſaid that there are Men in the World of very dull and ſhallow Capacities, and that Countrey People and Mechanicks cannot comprehend all theſe Maxims of Morality. This is not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as it is imagined. The Duties of Morality are clear, they preſently affect a Man, becauſe they are conſonant, to the common notices and ſentiments of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Chuſe what part of Morality you pleaſe, and you may with due endeavours, make either a Handy-crafts-man, or a Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96537:27"/>apprehend it; ſo you confine your ſelf, to the Knowledge and Practice of thoſe Duties, which are neceſſary to ſuch People in their ſeveral Callings. Is there any thing more ſubtil or difficult in the Rules of Morality, than there is in a hundred dexterities and ſhifts, which are practiſed in the Affairs of this Life; and which common People can attain to, without any great pains? If therefore Mens Underſtandings are ſo groſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid in moral Matters; is not becauſe theſe Matters are above their reach; but becauſe they were never taught them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or never applied themſelves to them. We ought not to judge of what Men might be by what they are. The beſt Ground becomes barren, when it is not cultivated. If things were well ordered among Chriſtians, in relation eſpecially to the inſtruction of the People, and the Education of Children; the generality of them, would not be ſo ſtupid and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as they are.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore conclude, that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is one of the general Cauſes of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Chriſtians being ill informed of the Truths and Duties of their Religion; and wanting inſtruction both as to Faith and Manners, they muſt needs live in a great neglect of Religious Matters.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96537:28"/>
                  <p>It may be asked, whence does this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance proceed? I ſhall obſerve three principal Cauſes of it. The firſt is Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the way in which Children are bred up, does infallibly lead to Ignorance. The ſecond is the want of Means to get good Inſtruction, and particularly the defect of thoſe Inſtructions which are delivered to Chriſtians, in Sermons, Catechiſms, and Books. The third is the Sloth and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of Men, who will be at no pains to acquire neceſſary Knowledge. We might beſtow very weighty Conſiderations upon every one of theſe three Heads; but ſince they will again come in our way, in the ſequel of this Treatiſe, it is enough to have pointed at them in this place, as the three main Sources of Ignorance. In truth, if Men are ill Educated, if they are deſtitute of the neceſſary Means of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and take no care about it; whence ſhould they have ſufficient Knowledge? unleſs they were inſtructed by Miracles, by Revelations, and Inſpirations, they cannot but be Ignorant and Corrupt.</p>
                  <p>But now if Ignorance be the firſt Cauſe of Corruption; it is plain that the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to be uſed againſt Corruption, is the removing that Ignorance. It is that we are to begin at, if we would bring back Chriſtians, to a Life worthy of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96537:28"/>they profeſs. Exhortations, Cenſures, and all other ſuch Methods, will ſignifie nothing, as long as Mens Minds are not prepared by proper Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>From all that has been ſaid in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it may be gathered; that the right way to inſtruct Men, is before all things to convince them of the Truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to make them ſenſible that there is nothing more certain, or of greater Conſequence in the World, than the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity. The Belief of the General Truths, ought eſpecially to be well fixed in their Minds, as that there is a God, a Providence, a Judgment and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life. After this we muſt proceed to the particular Truths of the Goſpel, and as we go on in explaining them, we ought to ſhew, what influence thoſe Truths have upon Holineſs and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt important thing of all, when theſe Truths are ſettled; is to ſhew that the bare Knowledge of the Chriſtian Doctrines, is not able to make Men happy; that the ſcope of Religion, is to make Men truly good; and that without Piety and good Works there is no Salvation.</p>
                  <p>It will not be ſufficient to recommend Sanctification in general, but the Nature of it muſt beſides be diſtinctly explained; it muſt be ſhewed which are the general and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96537:29"/>particular Obligations, of a Chriſtian life, and what Sins are contrary to theſe. And here thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to inſtruct the People, ought to be as particular, as poſſibly they can; ſhewing upon each Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice what the Nature of it is, and what are the ſeveral Characters, Kinds, and Degrees of it; and propoſing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Motives, which ſhould diſcourage Men from thoſe Vices, and prompt them to the practice of the oppoſite Virtues; as alſo the Directions which may facilitate the performance of all theſe Duties. When Teachers ſhall go thus to work, they will ſoon perceive ſome Amendment; God's Bleſſing will accompany the uſe of thoſe Means which he has appointed. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being rightly informed will of their own accord apply themſelves Virtue to; Corruption will leſſen by degrees; and Chriſtianity recovering its ancient Luſtre, will begin to appear with another Face, than it does at this day.</p>

                  <head>CAUSE II. Prejudices and Falſe Notions concerning Religion.</head>
                  <p>HOW Ignorant and Corrupt ſoever Men may be, they cannot live ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely without Religion; very few at leaſt can go ſo far. If they are hindered by their Corruption, to know and practiſe pure Chriſtianity; yet a remnant of Light and Conſcience within them, does not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to run themſelves wholly into Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to lay aſide all thoughts of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to reconcile theſe two Principles, of which one draws them off from Religion, and the other leads them to it; they form to themſelves ſuch Ideas of Religion, as are agreeable to their Inclinations, and flatter their Security; and being poſſeſſed with thoſe Ideas, they confirm themſelves more and more in their Corruption. Theſe falſe Notions and Prejudices are worſe than Ignorance, and prove a greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the reviving of Virtue and Piety. It is better to deal with Men who are ſimply Ignorant, than with People who have wrong Apprehenſions, and are full
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96537:30"/>of Prejudices. The former being not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, may more eaſily be reclaimed; but it is much harder to prevail upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged Perſons, eſpecially in point of Religion; becauſe while they maintain their Errors, they fancy they defend the Truth, and that they promote the Glory of God. Falſe Notions and Prejudices in Religion, are therefore one of thoſe Cauſes of Corruption, which it concerns us moſt to take notice of. I ſhall endeavour to point at the chief of them in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt I ſhall name, is the Opinion of thoſe, who think that Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to comfort Men, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them happy. And it is no wonder that Men ſhould commonly reſolve all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into this. The deſire of Happineſs is natural to Men; and as they are ſenſible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerious Conſideration, that perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is not to be obtained in this World, if it were for no other reaſon but that they muſt die; they ſeek in Religion ſome Conſolation and Remedy, againſt that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal neceſſity, of quitting all the Pleaſures and Advantages of this preſent Life. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſenſe of their Corruption ſhould reſtrain them from flattering themſelves with the hopes of Salvation; but they rely upon the aſſurances of the Divine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96537:30"/>Mercy, which Religion gives to Men; and they perſuade themſelves, that their Sins will not obſtruct their Felicity. This is properly the Notion which Men enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Religion, and that which they think it is good for. But that Religion ſhould indiſpenſably oblige Men to fear God and to live well, and that without this, there is neither true Religion, nor Happineſs; is that which is not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed.</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion but that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Religion is to comfort Men, and to lead them to Happineſs. This was God's purpoſe in ſending his Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the World. But this is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end of Religion; it is intended beſides for the Glory of God and the Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men; and it does properly conſiſt in the Service and Obedience which are paid to God. Salvation is a conſequence of this Service, and a gratuitous Reward, which God is pleaſed to beſtow upon thoſe, who honour and fear him. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore is more abſurd than the conceit of thoſe, who look only upon that ſide of Religion, which promiſes Comfort and Salvation; and nothing is more dangerous or more apt to make Men remiſs and careleſs in their Duty; yet this imagination is very common, and if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96537:31"/>I was to define Religion, by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſions which Men have of it, I would ſay; that it is nothing elſe, but a mean to bring Sinners to Heaven, and to make Men eternally happy, whatſoever their courſe and manner of Life may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> But Men would not ſo eaſily promiſe themſelves Salvation, if they had not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean and imperfect Ideas of Religion. I ſhall therefore obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Men commonly place Chriſtianity, either in bare Knowledge, or in an external Profeſſion, or in Confidence. But Holineſs does not make a part of their Notion of Religion, or at beſt it makes but a very inconſiderable part of it.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be denied but that Knowledge is eſſential to Religion, and that as it holds the firſt rank in it, ſo it is the Foundation of it all. Nay it is impoſſible to engage Men to Holineſs, without laying firſt in them the Foundation of good and ſound Doctrine. This I have proved in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe. An outward and publick Profeſſion is likewiſe eſſential to Religion, for one cannot be a Chriſtian without it. And further, It is beyond all doubt, that Religion inſpires Confidence, Peace and Joy. The Knowledge of Chriſt, and of the Salvation he has procured for us, muſt naturally produce theſe effects.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96537:31"/>Knowledge, Profeſſion, and Confidence, are therefore included in the Idea of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but as neceſſary as they are, yet they are not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge is not the whole of Religion, ſince the Goſpel as well as Experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us, that it may be found in the worſt of Men; it is not therefore a ſaving knowledge but when it produces Piety and Charity. The Definition which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of the Chriſtian Religion, is that it is <hi>a knowledge of the truth according to godlineſs.</hi> We may read what the ſame Apoſtle tells us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Knowledge which is void of Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIII. As for an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it is altogether uſeleſs without Sanctity. A Hypocrite may live in the Church, and perform even with Applauſe, the external Duties of Piety. This we may likewiſe learn from Scripture and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Experience. Laſtly, All Confidence which is not ſupported by Piety, is vain and deceitful. The bare perſuaſion that one ſhall be ſaved, gives no Man a Right to Salvation. A very wicked Perſon may without any ground rely upon God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and this is what Divines call Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Security.<note place="bottom">* Tit. I. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:96537:32"/>
                  <p>But tho' all this is very plain, both from Scripture and good Senſe, yet Men enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Opinions contrary to it. A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think themſelves Chriſtians, becauſe they know the Truths and Doctrines of Chriſtianity. I do not enquire here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thoſe who think they know Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, do really know it. But howſoever this Knowledge true or falſe, makes many judge moſt favourably of themſelves; it does ſo puff them up, that they look on themſelves as the Stays and Supporters of Religion. Others, of whom there is an infinite number, imagine that ſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the true Religion, they need not fear any thing concerning their Salvation; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if this outward Profeſſion is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome apparent Zeal, and ſome aſſiduity in the publick Exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Laſtly, it is believed by many that God requires nothing elſe of Men, but Confidence, and that if they are in that Diſpoſition they cannot come ſhort of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. They think that in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is enough to acknowledge that they are miſerable Sinners, and to truſt in he Divine Mercy, and in the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This laſt Prejudice which reduces Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to Acts of Confidence, is perhaps the commoneſt of all. And yet if we were to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96537:32"/>determine which of theſe Three, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge, Profeſſion, and Confidence, is the leaſt eſſential to Religion; we muſt ſay, that it is Confidence. It is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable and contradictory, that a Man ſhould be a Chriſtian without Knowing and without making publick Profeſſion of his Religion: But a Man may be a Chriſtian and a good Man too, and yet want Confidence. For as it frequently happens that a bad Man, is animated with a falſe Confidence; ſo a good Man may have a timorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and be poſſeſſed with groundleſs Fears. Sometimes Melancholy, or a want of Knowledge, or of force of Mind, or even Conſtitution, may throw good Men into a State in which they feel no comfort. But without inſiſting upon this; it is viſibly an Error as common as it is pernicious, for Men to pretend, that Knowledge, Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Confidence, are ſufficient to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when they are ſeparated from the practice of Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be objected, That no Man has theſe Opinions, and that every Body acknowledges, that Religion obliges Men to be Holy. I grant that no Man does expreſly exclude Holineſs; it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all, that the practice of it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But yet I maintain, that it is look'd upon as the leaſt neceſſary thing in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96537:33"/>Religion. And to prove this; I need but alledge the difference which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Knowledge, Profeſſion, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and the practice of good Works. The Three firſt are generally preſſed and recomended in another manner than the laſt.</p>
                  <p>As to Knowledge, it is not without Reaſon repreſented as abſolutely neceſſary; it is ſaid, that a Man muſt know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; and whoever denies any one of them, is excluded from Salvation. This neceſſity are extended to many Doctrines, which is not of the ſame importance with Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths; many Queſtions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and all theſe Deciſions are made Articles of Faith. If any one raiſes any Doubt about them, he is treated as a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and People cry out as if Religion was upon the brink of Ruin. So that upon this Head extreme ſeverity is uſed, every Fault is Capital, and no allowance is made for Humane Infirmity.</p>
                  <p>As to outward Profeſſion; the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it is openly maintained, and not without juſt Cauſe. In this Point Man's Duty, and the Precepts of the Goſpel are rigorouſly preſſed. The leaſt diſſembling of a Man's Belief, the leaſt Act of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Worſhip, is called Apoſtacy. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96537:33"/>that Men are bound upon pain of Damnation, to forſake and ſuffer all; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than do any thing againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In relation to this nothing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or ſoftned, and the weak and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, are no ways indulg'd.</p>
                  <p>As to Confidence, it is ſpoken of in ſuch a manner, as makes People conceive, that it is the more effectual to Salvation, the firmer it is, and the more removed from doubt. The greateſt Sinner relies boldly upon the Mercy of God, and does not queſtion but that he has a Right to apply to himſelf all the Promiſes of the Goſpel, provided he believe; that is to ſay, as it is meant, ſo he has but Confidence enough.</p>
                  <p>But when the practice of good Works is Diſcourſed of, the Declarations of the Goſpel are not preſſed with the ſame rigor. That Zeal which upon all other Heads hearkens to no Accommodation, becomes here very tractable; and a great deal of remiſneſs appears as to this Article. The Doctrines are preſſed, Publick Profeſſion is ſtrictly enforced, and Confidence is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended: But it is ſaid, That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties muſt not be ſo ſeverely urged, and that ſomething is to be allowed for Humane Frailty. And yet it ſeems that as the Scripture inculcates nothing ſo much, as the neceſſity of a good Life; ſo it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96537:34"/>to inſiſt as much at leaſt upon this Point, as upon any other, and that it ſhould not be rank'd as it is, in the loweſt Degree, and among the leaſt neceſſary Things. One would think likewiſe, that the preſſing Sanctification, is to require nothing of Men, but what is as eaſy, if not more, than certain other Duties, which are abſolutely impoſed on them, upon pain of Damnation; ſuch as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all that is dear to them in this World, and the ſuffering of Death in time of Perſecution. But without enlarging upon this Subject, it is evident, that the generality of Chriſtians, do not believe, that Holineſs is ſo eſſential a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it really is; and that they do not well underſtand the nature of Chriſtianity; from whence it neceſſarily follows, that they muſt neglect the practice of Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> But there are ſome Prejudices, which do yet more directly attack Piety, and they are thoſe which People entertain concerning Piety and Morality it ſelf. I ſhall inſtance this firſt in the Opinion of thoſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Morality, is not of ſuch great Moment in Religion; who ſpeak of it with Contempt, and cry it down; and who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably ſetting Faith in oppoſition to Good-works; maintain, that it is enough to believe, and that thoſe who inſiſt upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96537:34"/>Morals do not apprehend the Nature of the Goſpel. Now one would think that ſuch Abſurd and Unchriſtian Imaginations, ſhould be univerſally rejected; but becauſe whatever gratifies Corruption is uſually welcome to Men; theſe Opinions have their Advocates, even among Divines, as might eaſily be ſhewn from the Printed Works of ſome Authors, who ſeem to have had a deſign to diſparage Good-works, and to oppoſe the neceſſity of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. This Prejudice overturns the Foundations of Morality, by deſtroying its neceſſity, and rendring it Contemptible. I only give here a hint of it, becauſe I am to ſhew in other Places, that it is the heighth of Extravagance, thus to ſet up Faith againſt Morality, to aſcribe all to the one, and to ſpeak but very ſlightly of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> And yet ſome People do not ſtop here. They think it is dangerous to inſiſt ſo much upon Morality; nay, ſome have proceeded ſo far, as to ſay, This was one of the Characters of Hereſy. I confeſs, this Opinion is not very common. It ought not to be imputed to the People, nor even to the Libertines. None but a few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Divines, have had the face to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, which by the by increaſes the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, that is occaſioned by ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96537:35"/>I am willing to believe that thoſe who advance them, qualify them with ſome Reſtrictions, and that they are not ſenſible of the terrible Conſequences which flow from them; but that they have been betrayed into the Speaking, or Writing of ſuch things, either through ſome Prejudice, or through the heat of Diſpute.

                  <p>By this, the Truth of Religion is as much ſtruck at and injured as Piety it ſelf. It gives one an Indignation to ſee, that the Honour of defending Vertue and Piety, ſhould be yielded up to Hereticks. To ſay that for the moſt part, Hereticks are ſtrong upon the Head of Morality, is in a manner to give up the Cauſe; it is the ready way to confirm them in their Errors; and it does baſely to aſcribe that to Hereſy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to True Religion, and is the Glory of it. It would be to no purpoſe to alledge that ſome Hereticks have writ upon Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with good Succeſs. For granting this to be true, it is not a Token of their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; on the contrary, ſo far they are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. Some Orthodox Chriſtians have recommended Morality as much and better than the Hereticks, becauſe they have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it upon the Foundations and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which pure Doctrines afford. On the other hand, there have always been Hereticks, who did ſubvert and ruin Morality; as for inſtance, thoſe who are deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2d to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:96537:36"/>and by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his 2d Epiſtle. It is then very unreaſonable to ſay, That a thing which neither agrees to all Hereticks, nor to Hereticks alone, is a Mark of Hereſy. There is much more reaſon to charge thoſe who ſpeak ſo injuriouſly of Morality; with maintaining a Hereſy, which comes very near that of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Apoſtles, and Condemned and Deteſted by the whole Church, as Corrupters of the Morals of the Goſpel.</p>

This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Prejudice, which does not a little contribute to that neglect of Piety they live in.

But the Error lies in imagining, too great an eaſineſs in this, and in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering aright, the Nature and the extent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96537:36"/>of the Duties of Morality. There are but few whoſe Notions in this Matter, come up to the Standard of the Goſpel, and to that Perfection which Chriſtians are to aim at. Few underſtand to what degree the practice of Vertue is to be carried: As for the purpoſe; what ſort of Juſtice, Equity, Honeſty, Diſintereſtedneſs, Purity, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity becomes a Profeſſor of Chriſt's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Inſtead of riſing up to that high and ſublime Pitch of Morality which the Goſpel demands; and inſtead of being acted by Noble Views and Deſigns wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Chriſtianity; Men commonly take up with mean and ſlight Apprehenſions of it. According to the general Opinion, a very extraordinary and elevated Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is not requiſite, in order to be a good Man. It is enough for a Man if he is not a notorious Villain, or a profligate Wretch; and if he obſerve ſome of thoſe Duties which have a ſhew of Sanctity. Thus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is reduced to the loweſt Degree of Vertue, or rather, to the leaſt degree of Sin; it is brought to very little, and yet that little is often neglected; for Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go ſo far in Practice as they do in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; they always do leſs than they think themſelves bound to do; ſo that their Actions ſtill fall ſhort of the Idea which they form of their Duty.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:96537:37"/>
                  <p n="6">6. What Judgment then are we to make of Chriſtians now a-days? Tho' they ſhould Act ſuitably to their Notion of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Morality; yet they would diſcharge their Duty but very indifferently, becauſe that Notion is but low and defective. But yet as mean and imperfect as it is, their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice does not reach it. They frequently allow themſelves in things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Conſcience; and tho' they violate the cleareſt and the eaſieſt Rules of Vertue, yet they fancy thoſe to be Sins from which no Man is free, and which will however be forgiven. At this rate Corruption muſt needs be very great.</p>
                  <p>But as Men often form to themſelves too eaſie a Notion of Piety, ſo they have ſometimes too ſevere an Idea of it. It may perhaps ſeem at firſt ſight, that it is not very neceſſary to remark and confute this Prejudice. The general depravation of Manners ſeems to make it evident, that the Notions which prevail at this time are not the rigid ones, and that Men do not much trouble themſelves about the Rules, of too auſtere a Devotion or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.

Such Maxims may be true in ſome reſpect; but they are falſe and extravagant, when they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without Diſtinction or Explication. By the Deſcriptions which are ſometimes made of the Vanity of the World, and of Devotion; one would think, that a Man cannot live like a Chriſtian; without lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, all ſecular Concerns and Buſineſs, and giving up himſelf to Solitude and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. Now this is what few Men are capable of; and beſides it is againſt the Order of Providence, which has placed us in the World, to live and labour in it, and to enjoy the good things which the Divine Liberality has provided for us.</p>

                  <p>That which is aſſerted by ſome Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, concerning the Love of God, and their Zeal for his Glory; ſuppoſes that Men are obliged, to think actually upon God at all times, and to have a poſitive inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to promote his Glory in all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their lives. But ſuch Morality to ſay no more, is abſurd, and impoſſible to be reduced to practice. It is not poſſible for a Man to have God always in his thoughts, and to make pious Reflections upon every ſtep he takes, or every word he ſpeaks And there are ſuch Actions in Life, which cannot without Profanation be referred to the Glory of God by a direct intention St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed enjoins us,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. X. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>to do all things to the glory of God;</hi> But this Rule is not to be taken in the utmoſt ſtrictneſs, nor extended to all particular Actions. It is enough to have a ſincere and general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to procure God's Glory, and to do ones duty upon all occaſions. In order to which theſe Four Things are neceſſary. 1. That we ſhould not fail to think of God actually, in all thoſe Actions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. 2. That if by reaſon of the preſent State we are in, we cannot think on God at all times, and in all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96537:39"/>we ſhould at leaſt think often upon him, and make frequent Reflections upon our own Conduct. 3. That in indifferent Actions, we ſhould not abuſe our Liberty, but demean our ſelves according to the Rules which the Goſpel preſcribes; and that we ſhould eſpecially have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Edification of our Neighbour; it being particularly in that ſenſe that this Commandment <hi>of doing all things to the Glory of God,</hi> is to be underſtood. 4. That we ſhould love God above all things, and that it ſhould be our chief Care and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to Obey him, and to advance his Glory to the utmoſt of our Power.</p>
                  <p>How many Scruples have been infuſed into Mens Minds, by ſtraining the ſenſe of this Declaration of our Saviour's,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. XII. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>Men ſhall give an account at the Day of Judgment of every idle word that they ſhall ſpeak?</hi> What Inferences have not been drawn from this Place, to fill good Men with dread and terror? It is Expounded as if all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which neither contribute to the Glory of God, nor to the Edification of our Neighbours, nor to the promoting of our own Salvation; were thoſe <hi>idle Words,</hi> of which Men are to give an Account to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96537:40"/>God. And yet it does not appear that Words purely idle, are always ſinful, or that they deſerve the ſevere threatning, which our Saviour denounces here. We cannot forbear talking every Day, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indifferent things, and holding ſeveral Diſcourſes, which do neither good nor harm. Indeed if this ſhould grow into a Habit, if we ſhould for the moſt part ſpeak only of trifling and frivolous Things; it would be a Sin. But I do not apprehend what hurt there can be, in talking now and then of News, of Rain, or of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Certainly theſe are not the Words which are meant in this Declaration. The Place where we find it, and the Terms in which it is conceived; do manifeſtly ſhew, our Saviour's meaning to be this; That Men ſhall give an Account at the Day of Judgment, of all the Wicked and Impious Words which they have ſpoken; and that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> particularly ſhould be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God, for the Blaſphemies which they uttered againſt his Miracles.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtrain'd Maxims produce very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Effects. They expoſe Piety to the Flouts and Contempt of Libertines; and they diſcourage great Numbers from it Young People eſpecially, are by this means diſguſted with Religion, and they take up an Averſion to it, which they ſeldom ſhake
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96537:40"/>off afterwards. They accuſtom themſelves in that Age which is ſo ſenſible of Pleaſure, to look upon Piety under an auſtere and melancholy Form; whilſt on the ſide of the World and of their Paſſions, they ſee nothing but ſweetneſs and charms, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Two Objects; one of which is ſo enticing, and the other ſo diſguſtful; it is eaſy to imagine which ſide they will chuſe. They run into the embraces of the World with the full ſwing of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But as to Religion they muſt be urged and driven; and it is much if they can be brought to make ſome ſteps towards it. Even good Men being diſcouraged by this exceſſive ſeverity; do not make that progreſs in Sanctification, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might. Their Conſciences are diſturbed with troubleſom Scruples and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fears. It is therefore very neceſſary to remove this Prejudice; by repreſenting Vertue and Piety, under that eaſy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſhape which is natural to them; and by propoſing ſuch Ideas of Religion, as may neither on the one hand, produce Security, and lull Mens Conſciences aſleep, nor on the other hand, involve them in groundleſs Scruples.</p>

And there are many who have ſuch an Opinion of Piety: Which proceeds firſt from the Ignorance and Corruption of Men; who becauſe they are not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Religion, or are poſſeſſed with falſe Notions of Honour; look with Contempt upon every thing, which does not agree with the prevailing Cuſtoms and Maxims of the World. And then we may take notice beſides, that Libertines do ſometimes obſerve either in that Religion which obtains in the Society wherein they live; or in the Deportment of thoſe who have the reputation of being Devout, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, which lead them into this Opinion. With relation to Doctrines, they find certain Articles which Men of good Senſe cannot digeſt, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive manifeſt Abuſes in the Worſhip; they ſee the People amuſed with Childiſh Devotions, which ſavour of nothing elſe but Superſtition, Credulity or Bigottry. Some of thoſe who do profeſs Devotion ſeem to them to hold Opinions, contrary to ſound Reaſon, and to have ſome odd and ridiculous ways with them. They perhaps, obſerve in the Miniſters of Religion ſeveral Whimſies, Ignorances, and Weakneſſes; they do not always find the beſt Senſe in Diſcourſes of Piety, neither do they think
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96537:42"/>the Idea which is given them of Religion and it's Duties, to be True, Rational, or Satisfactory. From all this they conclude, that to give themſelves up to it, would be a diſgrace to them; that it is calculated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Vulgar, and for weak Minds; and that the being neither Pious nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, argues a ſtrength and a greatneſs of Soul. This certainly is a moſt falſe and unjuſt Prejudice. There is nothing more ſerious, nor more worthy of Eſteem and Reſpect than Religion, and it is the higheſt pitch of Injuſtice, to take an Eſtimate of it by the Errors and Weakneſſes of Men. But yet this Prejudice is very common.</p>

                     </gap> Account of myſtical Piety and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. It is a Subject upon which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak very clearly, becauſe we can
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96537:43"/>hardly have perſpicuous and diſtinct Ideas of it; beſides, that the <hi>Myſticks</hi> are not agreed among themſelves: They are a Sect which is ſub-divided almoſt to Infinity, For not to mention the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Quietiſts,</hi> and all thoſe who come up to the heighth of Fanatical Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances; there are many particular Sects which would ſcorn the Name, and yet are wholly, or in part, poſſeſſed with the Principles of the Fanaticks. But in the main here is their Character.</p>
                  <p>They are almoſt all agreed in one thing; which is, that they make but very little count of Outward Means, and of thoſe Acts which concern the <hi>Exterior</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſuch are the Order of the Church, Government, Diſcipline, Preaching, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and the publick Exerciſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. All theſe, if we believe them, are to be conſidered, as the firſt Elements of Piety, which are uſeful only to imperfect Chriſtians. They have no great Eſteem neither for thoſe Labours and Studies, by which Men endeavour to acquire Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. They reaſon little about Religion, and for the moſt part, they alledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments for the Articles of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but the inward Senſe they have of them. They do not condemn Morality and Good-works, but among themſelves,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96537:43"/>they ſpeak but feebly of them, and in ſuch a ſtrain, as leſſens conſiderably their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and neceſſity. They ſay, That our Works are nothing but Deſilement and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination; that God does not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Works, and that Man ought not to judge of his Condition by them; but that all depends upon Faith, and an Union with God. Hence it is that thoſe Books, which lay a great ſtreſs upon the Practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Virtues, do not reliſh beſt with them. They prefer Contemplations, Meditations and inward Recollections, before an active Life and the practice of Morality. Nay there are ſome who think, that all the care which Men uſe, and all the efforts that they make to advance in Piety, ſignifie but little. According to them, the way to Perfection and ſolid Vertue, is for a Man to be in a State of <hi>inaction,</hi> to go out of himſelf, to <hi>annihilate</hi> himſelf; to have neither Thoughts, nor Deſires, nor Will, but to be as it were <hi>dead</hi> in the ſight of God; for thus they expreſs themſelves in figurative and myſterious Words. Under pretence of aſcribing all to God, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that Man is a meer Nothing, and an <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Miſery; that in order to be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, it is enough for us to be ſenſible of our <hi>Nothingneſs,</hi> and to wait in <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Tranquility,</hi> till God is pleaſed to work his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96537:44"/>Will in us; and that when the Soul is thus in the State of <hi>inaction,</hi> and entirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons it ſelf to God, then it is, that God ſpeaks to, and operates in it. What they ſay concerning Man's <hi>Nothingneſs,</hi> does not hinder but that moſt of them pretend to be in a State of Perfection, and look upon the reſt of Chriſtians, as Carnal Men, who are yet in darkneſs, and who never taſted that which they call the <hi>Heavenly Gift.</hi> I might relate here their refining upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love and upon Prayer; but what I have ſaid is ſufficient, to diſcover the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Character of Fanaticiſm.</p>
                  <p>I am far from charging all thoſe who hold theſe Opinions, with Hypocriſy and Impiety; I am perſuaded that there are good Men amongſt them, who are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their Errors; ſo that I cannot but blame the ſeverity which is uſed towards them in ſome Places, and the odious Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are caſt upon them in order to vilify them all, without diſtinction. If they err, it is for the moſt part, thro' Weakneſs and Prepoſſeſſion, rather than thro' Malice.</p>
                  <p>Nay it may be ſaid in their behalf, that theſe Illuſions would not have grown ſo Common, if there had not teen a general, and in ſome meaſure an incurable Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World. But they ſaw every where a prodigious decay of Piety, and little
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96537:44"/>hope of amendment. For what may we not ſay of the preſent State of Chriſtianity? There is in many Places an Ignorant and Superſtitious Clergy and People; whoſe whole Religion conſiſts, in Ceremonies, and in Devotions, which are merely External, and often Ridiculous; above all, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in thoſe Places a Deluge of Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Is it then to be wonder'd at, that Quietiſm and Fanaticiſm ſhould rear up their Heads in ſuch Places? Theſe groſs Abuſes do not indeed prevail everywhere; but generally ſpeaking, there is but little of true Piety among Chriſtians, there is ſcarce any Order or Diſcipline left amonſt them; Men live as they pleaſe; the Sacraments are prophaned; the Precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are trampled under foot; Charity and Honeſty are almoſt entirely baniſhed. No Man ſets about the redreſſing of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; Church-men make it their Capital Buſineſs, to maintain their Diſputes and their Tenets, and they apply themſelves but faintly to the reforming of Manners. Religion being upon this Foot, many who had good Intentions, could not but perceive that this was not true and genuine Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. But becauſe they ſaw no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Things being brought to a better poſture; or becauſe they wanted Capacity to find out the Occaſions and Remedies of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96537:45"/>ſo great an Evil; or laſtly, becauſe they were Men of weak parts; they hearkned to thoſe who propoſed to them this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Piety.</p>
                  <p>This is the Cauſe of the progreſs of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm, and the Reaſon why ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Vertue and Piety are engag'd in that Party. And therefore the true way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, would be to re-eſtabliſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Church, and to labour for the Reformation of Manners. As long as theſe are neglected, all the Precautions and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods uſed againſt Fanatick's by the Clergy or by the Magiſtrate, will either prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful, or be found contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But after all, this Spirit of Fanaticiſm is highly pernicious. For firſt it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a Gap to all manner of Licentiouſneſs. Not to mention the Miſchieſs which may redound from thence upon Civil Society; Myſtical Piety is at large Fountain of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; it leads Men into endleſs Errors, and it is apt to turn all Religion upſide down; for as it is lodged only in inward Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it cannot happen otherwiſe, but that vaſt Numbers of Men who either want Knowledge or Strength of Parts, will take the wandrings of their own Fancies, for Divine Inſpirations. I know that ſome of thoſe. Contemplative Men, acknowledge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96537:45"/>the Scripture for the Rule of their Faith, and read it carefully; but the miſchief is, that thro' their Prejudices, they fix a wrong Senſe upon it, ſo that what they read does but confirm them in their Errors. Their Expoſitions are very ſingular; they do not affix to Words the ſame Ideas which other Men do; they forſake the literal Senſe, to run after myſtical Explications ſuitable to their preconceived Notions; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or make very light of thoſe Helps which the Knowledge of Languages, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and the Scope of Sacred Writers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; and it is one of their Principles, That Women, Mechanicks, and the moſt ſimple People, are able to underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as well, if not better, than the moſt Learned Doctors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fanaticiſm is an Evil which is hardly to be remedied. A Heretick, or a prophane Perſon, may ſooner be undeceived, than a Man intoxicated with Myſtical Devotion; for theſe will Reaſon, but the other will hearken to no Reaſoning; ſo that he is Proof againſt all the Arguments which can be offered to him. It is in vain to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with People, who look on all thoſe who are not of their Mind, as Ignorant Men; who think themſelves Illuminated above the reſt of Mankind, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no other Anſwer to the Objections
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96537:46"/>urged againſt them, but that they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perſuaded in their Minds. There is no good to be done upon them; either by Reaſoning or by Senſe, of which they make but little uſe; or even by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein they ſeek nothing leſs, than the literal meaning,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Tho' Myſtical Men profeſs a ſublime Piety; yet their Principles favour Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption more than one may be apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. How can we reconcile thoſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims concerning <hi>Contemplation, Inanition</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> with that Activity, Zeal, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which the Scripture recommends? If Man is a mere Nothing, if he is to wait patiently till God works his Will in him, and ſpeaks to his Soul; it is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Men, and it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for them, to uſe any endeavours on their part. Beſides, that Contempt of outward means which the <hi>Myſticks</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, makes way for a total neglect of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, introduces Diſorder and Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and is directly oppoſite to God's deſign, who thought fit to preſcribe the uſe of thoſe means. I might add that the Principles of Fanaticiſm, are commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enough for Sinners, ſo that I do not wonder, that ſome of them ſhould go over to that Party. A Devotion which conſiſts in acknowledging a Man's own
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96537:46"/>
                     <hi>Nothingneſs,</hi> or in <hi>Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> is much more acceptable to a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Perſon, than an exact Morality, which obliges a Man, to do acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to put his own hand to the work, and to ſet about the reforming of his Life, and the practiſing of Chriſtian Virtues.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole matter, Fanaticiſm makes Religion contemptible; becauſe the Men of the World confound true, with Myſtical Piety. They fancy that a Man cannot be devout, without being ſomething Viſionary and Enthuſiaſtical; and that Devotion does not well agree with Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Prejudices I have mentioned in this Chapter, are not the only ones which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and cheriſh Corruption; ſome others might have been added, but they may more conveniently be ranged under the Titles of ſome of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. What I have ſaid in this, does yet farther ſhew the neceſſity of good Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which may conquer theſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and give Men true Notions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety.</p>

                  <p>IT has been ſhewn in two preceding Chapters, that Men are generally invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Ignorance, and that they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Notions concerning Religion and Piety, as muſt of neceſſity maintain Corruption in the World. But they are likewiſe poſſeſt with divers particular Maxims and Sentiments, which lead direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Libertiniſm. A modern Author very well obſerves;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>New Moral Eſſays,</hi> Tom. 1. in the Preface.</note> 
                     <hi>That People are not only very little acquainted, with the extent of that Purity which the Goſpel requires; but that they are beſides full of Maxims, incomparably more pernicious, than Errors of pure Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Theſe Maxims do the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly produce Corruption, becauſe they are uſed to Authoriſe and Countenance it. And in fact, Mens Blindneſs and Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are come to that paſs; that not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96537:47"/>being contented with the practice of Vice; they do beſides plead Authority for an ill Life. They proceed ſo far as to defend the Cauſe of Corruption; they diſpute with thoſe that condem them, and they vent ſuch Maxims and Sentiments, as (if we believe them) will juſtifie, or at leaſt excuſe all their Diſorders. I could not omit here the examining of thoſe, Maxims ſince their effect is ſo pernicious; I ſhall therefore obſerve them as the third Cauſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>The Maxims and. Sentiments which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Corruption are of two ſorts. Some are viſibly Profane and Impious; ſuch are a great many Maxims of the Libertines, which go for Currant in the World: But there are others which Men pretend to draw from Religion. I ſhall inſiſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon the latter, becauſe as they are taken from Religion it ſelf, they are by much the more dangerous. When Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane People, undertake to defend Vice with Maxims wich are manifeſtly impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we ſtand upon our guard againſt them, and we may confute them by the Maxims of Religion. But when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Religion and the Truths of it, in the defence of Vice; the danger of being fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced is infinitely greater.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:96537:48"/>
                  <p>I ſhall reduce the Maxims which are made uſe of to Authoriſe Corruption to theſe Four Orders.</p>
                  <p>I rank thoſe in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Order, by which Men endeavour to prove, that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Order contains thoſe which tend to ſhew, that the practice of Holineſs is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Comprehends thoſe which inſinuate, that it is dangerous for a Man to apply himſelf to good Works.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and the <hi>Laſt</hi> includes thoſe which are alledged to excuſe Corruption.</p>
                  <p>But as it is not leſs neceſſary, to know the Remedies againſt Corruption, than to diſcover the Cauſes of it; I ſhall not only mention, but as I go on Confute, thoſe Maxims.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Although nothing is more clearly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Goſpel, than the neceſſity of Good Works; yet Chriſtians entertain many Opinions which deſtroy this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and which conſequently open a Door to Licentiouſneſs. The neceſſity of Good-works cannot be overthrown but one of theſe two ways; either by ſaying that God does not require them; or elſe by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that tho' God requires them, yet a Man may be Saved without the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:96537:48"/>
                  <p n="1">1. In order to prove that God does not require Sanctity and Good-works, as a Condition abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, theſe two Maxims are abuſed. 1. <hi>That we are not ſaved by our Works.</hi> And 2. <hi>That Faith is ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> The firſt of theſe Maxims is intended to exclude Good-works; and by the ſecond Men would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another Mean for obtaining Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I referr the Diſcuſſing of theſe Two Maxims to the next Chapter, becauſe they are drawn from the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Men endeavour to perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that tho' they neglect Holineſs, yet for all that, they ſhall not be excluded from Salvation. And that which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes moſt to flatter them in this Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is firſt, The Notion they have formed to themſelves of the Mercy of God. <hi>God,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is Good, and will not judge us with the utmoſt rigour.</hi> This is ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day, and it makes every Body hope for Salvation. The Divine Mercy indeed is without queſtion, the only ground we have to hope for Salvation. But the vileſt Affront we can offer to that Mercy, is to make it an occaſion of Security. Becauſe God is Good and Merciful, muſt not we therefore endeavour to pleaſe him? May we freely offend him, becauſe he is Good, and we hope he will forgive us?</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:96537:49"/>
                  <p>Thoſe who Reaſon at this rate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand very little what the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is. They muſt ſuppoſe that it extends indifferently to all Men without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Obedience or Diſobedience. But this Suppoſition, is evidently falſe, and contrary to the Holy Scripture. The Effects of God's Mercy, are promiſed only to thoſe who fear him and depart from evil, and by conſequence, it is a falſe and pernicious Maxim, to ſay, <hi>So much Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not neceſſary; God is Good, and he will not mark ſeverely what is done amiſs.</hi> This is to aſcribe to God an eaſineſs and a connivance, utterly unbecoming the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Judge of the World.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid beſides, <hi>That God will not judge us rigourouſly.</hi> That indeed, is true; God is indulgent towards us, and the Goſpel is a Covenant of Grace, in which God has a great regard to our preſent Condition, and Weakneſs. But it is likewiſe certain, that God will judge us according to the rigour of the Covenant of Grace; and that no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be had for thoſe, who do not fulfil the Condition of the Goſpel; now this Condition, is a true Faith, inciting us to Holineſs. This muſt be granted, and we muſt acknowledge the neceſſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this Condition, and of leading a Holy Life; or elſe the Goſpel is but a Jeſt;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96537:49"/>and we muſt ſay, That God does not ſpeak ſeriouſly in it; that indeed, he preſcribes certain Conditions, that he Commands and Threatens; but that nothing of all this is to be ſtrictly underſtood; ſo that tho' a Man does not comply with the Conditions which God require, yet he ſhall feel the Effects of his Clemency. If this is true, there is an end of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will no doubt be replied, <hi>That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided vided a Man Repents, and asks God's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, he ſhall be Saved.</hi> This is an unqueſtionable Truth; ſo by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we mean that, which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and which conſiſts in a ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Sin, in true Converſion and Amendment of Life. But this is falſe, if by Repentance, we mean only a general Confeſſion of Sins, accompanied with ſome ſenſe of grief and fear, whereby Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hope at the Hour of Death, to attone for all the diſorder of a Vitious Life. I would ſhew here that this is no ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but that I am to handle this Matter purpoſely in another Chapter.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> If Men commonly neglect thoſe things, which are not very neceſſary; they apply themſelves much leſs, to thoſe which they think to be impoſſible.

                        </gap> God Commands.</hi> A great many like the Precepts of the Goſpel very well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Juſtice and Excellency; <hi>Would to God,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we might live thus, but we are not able to do it:</hi> And being poſſeſt with this Opinion, they uſe no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to practiſe thoſe Duties which they own to be Juſt; or to attain to that Holineſs, to which God calls them. And indeed, what Man would attempt that, which he looks upon as impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Now what is ſaid of Man's Incapacity to do good, is very true, when we ſpeak of Man conſidered barely as Man, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt State of Nature. But the Queſtion is, Whether thoſe whom God has reſcued out of that State, and called to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel; are incapable to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that degree of Holineſs, which he requires of them? The Apoſtles give us another Notion of thoſe who know and believe in Jeſus Chriſt. They repreſent to us indeed the miſerable Condition in which Men naturally are, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Corruption; but they tell us at the ſame time, that Chriſt is come to deliver them from that State;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Phil</hi> 4.13.</note> 
                     <hi>that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

                     <hi>That he who loves God keeps his Commandments, and overcomes the World.</hi> This plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that we are no longer in that State of Corruption and Death, wherein Man being left to himſelf, is a ſlave to Sin; or at leaſt that we ought to be no longer in that State, after all that which the Grace of God has done for us. It is the greateſt Injury, that can be done to Chriſt and his Grace, to ſay, That his Coming, his Death, his Goſpel, and his Spirit, are not able to Sanctify Men; and that after they are Redeemed and Adopted by God, it is impoſſible for them to be good, and to do what he Commands.</p>
                  <p>If this was true, where would be the Power of the Chriſtian Religion, and what could we think of God's proceeding when he addreſſes his Commandments to us? At this rate, he gives us a Law, not that we ſhould keep it; but rather to convince us that we cannot obſerve it. In this Caſe, what will become of our Saviour's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and what are We to think of thoſe pure and exalted Morals which he has
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96537:52"/>left us? Evangelical Holineſs will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an imaginary and unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Sanctity. Thoſe Ideas of Perfection will be but mere Ideas, without any reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; like thoſe of that Philoſopher, who form'd a fine Scheme of the beſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Common-wealth; but it was a Project which could never be executed. It were to be wiſhed, we might remember, that, Thanks be to God, we are no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Heathens; and that Men ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and not diſheartned by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Maxims and Diſcourſes. Which is the imitating thoſe Cowardly Spies, who after they had viewed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> went about to diſpirit the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to perſuade them, that the Conqueſt of that Land was impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not only ſaid, That we are not able to be ſo Holy as the Goſpel requires; but it is added beſides, <hi>that God would not have us be ſo; that he makes uſe of Sin to keep us humble, and to make us feel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant need we have of his Grace, as well as to kindle in us, the deſire of a better and more perfect Life.</hi> This Maxim repreſents Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as a thing unavoidable, agreeable to the Will of God, and in ſome meaſure uſeful. But what can be more falſe than to pretend, <hi>that God would not have us be Holy?</hi> Why then does he Command us
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96537:52"/>to be ſo? Why does St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the Will of God, to wit, your Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> What can be meant by theſe Words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>As he who has called you is Holy, be ye alſo holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for it is written, be ye holy, for I am Holy?</hi> If it be ſaid, that God would have us be Holy, but not perfectly Holy, as we ſhall be in Heaven: I ask no more, Who did ever pretend that we ought to be as Holy in this World, as we are to be in the Life to come? Nothing elſe is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Men, but that they ſhould be as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God would have them to be, and as Holy as his Grace enables them to be in this Life. To alledge againſt this, <hi>That God would not have us be ſo Holy;</hi> is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Evaſion, which implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this Maxim taken in that Senſe, which it firſt offers to the Mind, ſeems to make God the Author of Sin. For it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, not only that God would not have us to be ſo Holy, but which is more ſtrange, that he wills the contrary, that lie has his Views, Deſigns, and Reaſons, why he ſhould not permit us, to attain that degree of Holineſs, to which the Goſpel calls us.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96537:53"/>That is the meaning of theſe Words, <hi>That God makes uſe of Sin, to keep us humble, to make us feel the need we have of his Grace, and to make us long for another Life.</hi> If it was ſaid only, That God had ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to permit Sin: ſuch an Aſſertion would be true; but thoſe who alledge this Maxim, to excuſe themſelves from obeying the Goſpel, aſcribe to God a poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and a direct Intention, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Obedience impoſſible; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from his Holineſs and Juſtice, and which is manifeſtly contrary to thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations which he himſelf has made in Scripture. If it were further ſaid, That our Sins ought to humble us, and that they ſhould ſerve to make us wiſer, and more circumſpect for the time to come, and to raiſe in us a longing after a happier State; this would be very Reaſonable. But it does not follow from thence, that we are to aſcribe to God, thoſe Views and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which this Maxim aſcribes to him. There is a vaſt difference between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which God propoſes to himſelf, and the Event of Things. Theſe Two ſhould never be confounded. Neither ought the natural Effect of Sin, to be confounded with the Conſequences of it. The natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Sin can be no other but Evil; if the Conſequences of it are not always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96537:53"/>and if Men reap ſome Advantage from it, that is, as we ſay, by accident. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God has no need of Vice to form us to Humility; he has other Means enough to humble us, and to make us feel the need we ſtand in of his Grace; without being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to let us live under the Dominion of Sin, to produce thoſe Diſpoſitions in us. And there remains ſtill even in the very holieſt Men, matter enough for them to have recourſe to the Divine Mercy, and to aſpire to a better Life, notwithſtanding all the progreſs they can make in Holineſs. This will be fully cleared in the ſequel of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is another Maxim which is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty common; it is ſaid, <hi>That this World is the place of Corruption, that this Life is the time of Sin, and that Holineſs is reſerved for Heaven.</hi> Mens Minds are ſo infected with this Imagination; that we hear it ſaid every Day, even by thoſe who have ſome Piety; <hi>That we live in this World only to offend God, and that we do nothing but ſin.</hi> But certainly, nothing is more contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Than this, for tho' it is true, in a ſound ſenſe, that this World is the Place of Corruption, and that Sin will never be intirely aboliſhed but in Heaven; yet that does by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from ſerving and fearing God, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96537:54"/>long as we live here. The firſt thing a Chriſtian ought to know; is that God has placed him in this World, not to offend, but to glorifie and ſerve him. The Goſpel tells us, every where, that this Life is the time which God gives us to ſanctify our ſelves in. That this Earth is the Place where Chriſtian Vertues are to be praciſed; that now is the time to labour, <hi>to walk, to fight,</hi> and <hi>to ſow,</hi> if we intend to obtain Salvation; and that whoever neglects theſe Duties ſhall be ſhut out of Heaven. In the Life to come theſe Opportunities will be over, the Door will be ſhut, and the Sentence which God ſhall pronounce at the Day of Judgment, will be founded upon that which Men do in this Life.</p>
                  <p>Nay, we may draw an Argument from the nature of Holineſs it ſelf, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the practice of it is not referred to another Life. The greateſt part of the Duties which God preſcribes; ſuch as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Patience, Chaſtity, Sobriety, Almſgiving, and Hope, cannot be practiſed in Heaven. Here then, is the Time, the Place, and the Opportunity, to perform theſe Duties. Let us reflect upon what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> Chap. 11. There he declares, <hi>That the Grace of God which brings Salvation, teaches Men to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96537:54"/>World.</hi> That is, In this Life, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; and then he adds,<hi>looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He makes a diſtinction between the Duty, and the Hope of a Chriſtian; between this World and that which is to come. This Life is the time, and this World the place, wherein we ought to practiſe Temperance, Juſtice and Godlineſs. It muſt not be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Where the difference then lies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Life and the other, between Grace and Glory? For the difference is great and ſenſible enough in other Reſpects. In the next Life we ſhall be perfectly Holy; our Holineſs will be of another Nature than it is here; we ſhall be like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and as we ſhall practiſe no longer a great many Duties, which we practiſe here on Earth, ſo we ſhall exerciſe many Vertues, which cannot be exerciſed in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ought not to omit here another Maxim, which is not only very common, but is likewiſe moſt pernicious, by reaſon of the uſe that is made of it. Some ſay. <hi>That there was always, and that there will always be Corruption; that this is the way of the World, that Men will always be men, and that the World will not change.</hi> It is neceſſary to dwell a little upon this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, becauſe it is ſpecious, and tends as well
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96537:55"/>as the former, to make Men believe that Corruption is neceſſary and unavoidable. It has beſides a general Influence upon the Subject Matter and Deſign of this Book; for it is to little purpoſe to deſcant upon the Sources of Corruption, if there is no amendment to be hoped for. I have four Things to ſay upon this Maxim.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Inference which is made from it is abſurd. For tho' an Evil is general, it does not follow, that it is to no purpoſe to endeavour to keep our ſelves free from it; unleſs it were an Evil from which Men could not poſſibly preſerve themſelves There have been always and there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be Diſeaſes in the World; and yet no Man hitherto has been ſo weak as to maintain, that the Precautions and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are uſed againſt Diſeaſes, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſs. Thus tho Corruption reigns in the World; yet that does not hinder, but that Men ought to uſe their beſt endeavours to eſcape it; and it does not prove but that they may actually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, if they uſe thoſe means which God affords them to that end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Maxim is founded upon a falſe Suppoſition. For tho' it is true that there has been always, and that there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be Corruption in the World; yet it ought not to be ſuppoſed, that this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96537:55"/>is alike at all times, or that things are always to be in the ſame ſtate they now are in. This were a falſe Suppoſition and contrary to Experience, as may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be proved with reſpect to the Time paſt, the preſent and the future. Firſt, when we reflect upon paſt Ages, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that all Times have been alike, in reference to Religion. It is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that before Chriſt's coming, the World was plunged in a general Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the State of it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably altered by the Preaching of the Goſpel. Can any one deny but that the Primitive Church was purer, than the Church which we find in the Ninth or Tenth Century? At this day, tho' there is a general Diſſoluteneſs, yet there is more or leſs Corruption in ſome places than in others. It is true in Fact, that where the Goſpel is duly Preached, and where there is ſome Order and Diſcipline left, there appears more Piety and Religion than in other Places. As for the time to come we muſt not think it impoſſible to reſtore Things to a better State, or imagine, that the World will always continue as it is, tho' the Means were uſed which God has appointed to Reform it. For this will no ſooner be done, but Corruption will abate; as I hope to make it appear, in the Second Part of this Book.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:96537:56"/>
                  <p n="3">3. This Maxim is directly contrary to the Word of God. The Scripture often ſpeaks of the Corruption of the World, but does it always in ſuch a manner, as gives us to underſtand that Chriſtians may, and ought to renounce it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the ſinful Courſes which the World lies in, <hi>Eph.</hi> 11. But he ſuppoſes, that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> did no longer follow thoſe Courſes after they were Converted to the Chriſtian Religion. The ſame Apoſtle Commands us,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>not to be conformed to this preſent World.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Spirit and Character of that<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Jam</hi> 1.2, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>pure and undefiled Religion,</hi> which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, he tells us, among other things, that it conſiſts <hi>in man's keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Laſt place, this Maxim is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dangerous. In that Senſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in which it is propoſed, it leads to Impiety, it robs Religion of all its Power, and it furniſhes Libertines with a Plea, which does intirely juſtify them. For in ſhort, either Corruption may be remedied, and Men may be reduced to a more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life; or it may not. If it cannot be remedied, this Maxim is true, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96537:56"/>Men are in the right. But in that Caſe, I ſay it again, Religion is but a Name; for if no ſtop can be given to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, if things muſt ſtill go on at the ſame rate; why do we talk of Religion, or why do we Preach the Goſpel? We may teach and exhort as long as we pleaſe, but for all that, there will be neither more nor leſs Sin; Men will always be what they are, and the World will not alter. What Notion muſt this give us of the Efficacy of Chriſtianity, or of the ſincerity of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Promiſes and Threatnings? I grant then, that Corruption is great, that the Courſe of the World is very bad, and that in all probability, there will always be Wickedneſs upon Earth. But that this Corruption ſhould be always the ſame, ſo that no Reformation can be hoped; is what cannot be maintained without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting Religion, without introducing Fatality and extinguiſhing all Zeal among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> By the Maxims we have hitherto Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Men endeavour to prove, that the practice of Holineſs, is either of no great neceſſity, or that it is impoſſible. But there are ſome others, which repreſent the Study of Vertue, as dangerous; ſo that here vicious Men do not ſtand barely upon the defenſive part, but they attack
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96537:57"/>their Adverſaries, who recommend the Duties of Holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They pretend that we cannot inſiſt ſo much upon Works, without obſcuring the Glory of the Divine Mercy. <hi>We muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to Mercy, and nothing to our own Righteouſneſs.</hi> There is no true Chriſtian, but acknowledges, That our Salvation, is entirely owing to the Divine Mercy; and rejects the Opinion which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes any Merit to Good-works. It is that Mercy which gave us Chriſt for our Redeemer, and our Salvation is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Redemption. It is that Mercy which pardons the Sins of thoſe who Believe and Repent, and which bears with the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Regenerate Chriſtians. And it is from the ſame Mercy, that we expect that Glorious and un-merited Reward, which is laid up in Heaven for Good Men. All theſe are as many Acts of the pure Mercy of God. But as we have ſhewed that the Mercy which Saves us, does not excuſe us from Good-works, ſo the neceſſity of Good-works, does not leſſen in the leaſt the Riches of God's Mercy. Unleſs we admit that there are Contradictions in Scripture; we muſt acknowledge, that the Doctrine of Sanctification, does perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the Doctrine of Grace.</p>
                  <p>And in Truth, to ſay, That God gave
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96537:57"/>up his Son to Death, in order to Save Men, and that he will grant Remiſſion of Sins, and Eternal Happineſs, to every believing and repenting Sinner; is as much as can be ſaid to magnify the Divine Mercy: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we ſhould pretend, that God would be more merciful, if he did indifferently Save all Mankind, and Reward Vice and Vertue alike; but this would be a horrid Thought, and no leſs than downright Blaſphemy. Then Sinners might ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Let us continue in Sin, that Grace may abound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe that a Prince pardons a Rebellious Subject, and that he is ready to confer the greateſt Honours and Benefits upon him, on condition that this Subject, ſhall accept of the Pardon that is offered him, and ſhall relapſe no more into the ſame Crime; Would any Man be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to ſay; that the Clemency of that Prince would be much greater, if he did grant his Favours to this Rebel, tho' he ſhould perſiſt in his Crime? And yet this is the ſame thing which ſome Men would have God do. It is very ſtrange, that any one ſhould think to Honour God, by ſuch Conceits, as do not only injure his Mercy, but his other Perfections too. Becauſe God is Merciful, muſt we forget, that he is Holy, Juſt and Good? It is ſaid,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96537:58"/>
                     <hi>that we muſt aſcribe all to the mercy of God;</hi> what then, muſt we have no regard to his Holineſs, his Juſtice and his Truth? Muſt what the Scripture tells of theſe laſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, be faintly and tenderly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt we preſs and ſcrue up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch, what it ſays of Mercy?</p>
                  <p>As to what is added, <hi>that we ought to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe nothing to our own Righteouſneſs;</hi> it is unqueſtionably true. But do we aſcribe any thing to Man, when we ſay that he is bound to do his Duty, and to accept the favour which God is pleaſed to beſtow upon him? Can any Man ſay that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel I Mentioned juſt now, is the Author of his own Happineſs, and that he deſerves the Pardon granted him by his Prince; becauſe he accepts of it, and fulfils the condition, upon which it is offered? What reaſon then has a Man to value himſelf upon his own Righteouſneſs, or to arrogate any Merit to himſelf, ſince he is indebted to the Grace of God; both for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and the progreſs of his Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? In ſhort, we ſhould take heed, that for fear of aſcribing any thing to Man, we may not rob the Divine Grace of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, by not acknowledging its Gifts and Power in a Regenerate Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is another Maxim, which is alledged in Confirmation of the preceding,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96537:58"/>and which aims at the ſame Mark; It is this, <hi>That we muſt not ſpeak ſo much of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, leſt we inſpire Men with Pride and Preſumption.</hi> And to ſupport this Maxim it is uſual, to run out upon Mens inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Pride; and upon the heinouſneſs of that Sin. But this Maxim proceeds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the falſe and confuſed Notions which Men have about Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>Either this Maxim has no Senſe at all, or elſe it mounts to this; That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever applies himſelf to Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, is in danger of falling into Pride; and that a neglect of Vertue contains a Man within the Bounds of Humility. Which is as much as to ſay, that a Man may be Holy without Humility, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without Holineſs. Two Things which are the moſt ridiculous and contradictory, that can be aſſerted. At this rate it would be a dangerous thing to be a Good Man, and more ſafe to be otherwiſe. By purſuing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Holineſs a Man draws near to Sin, and to the greateſt of Sins, I mean Pride; and by neglecting Holineſs, he attains Humility, which is one of the chief Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues. If this is true, all that we call Vice or Vertue, is but an empty ſound. It is much that Men ſhould not ſee, that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96537:59"/>there can be no Holineſs without Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Humility without Holineſs; that where there is Holineſs, there is Humility, and Pride is excluded; and that where Pride is there is no true Sanctification. The holier a Man grows, he becomes the more humble; and he is ſo far from coming the nearer to Pride by proceeding in Hollineſs, that on the contrary he removes the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from it. The inſtance of our Bleſſed Saviour, who was both perfectly Holy, and perfectly Humble; is a proof, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is not incompatible with Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>But the Nature of Humility is not well underſtood. There are many who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no other Humility, but that which ariſes from the Diſorders of a vicious and irregular Life. So that when they would humble good Men, they rank them among the vileſt Sinners; they make them ſay, that there is nothing but Wickedneſs and Abomination in them; and that they have deſerved Eternal Damnation by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sins which they have committed, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment of their Lives, and even by the beſt Actions they have done. The ſtrongeſt Expreſſions and the moſt exceſſive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hyperboles; are ſcarce ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate the number and greatneſs of their Sins. But there is enough of other Inducements and Motives to Humility,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96537:59"/>without thus confounding Vice with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. It would be a pretty ſort of Humility, for a Man to live in Sin, to be at defiance with God, to do nothing for his ſake, and then with all this to confeſs himſelf a miſerable Sinner.</p>
                  <p>Pride and Preſumption ſhould not be encouraged; but yet under the pretence of humbling Men, we ought not to turn them into Blocks, or to confound a good Man, with a profligate Sinner. When we inveigh againſt the Pride of Man, we ought not to ſink his Courage; for that would immediately make him incapable of any thing that is good. Under colour of Honouring God, we muſt not diſhonour his Workmanſhip, ſpeak ſlightingly of his Gifts, and overlook his Image, in thoſe who bear it in a double Capacity; as they are Men, and as they are Chriſtians. It is a piece of Pride, to arrogate any thing to our ſelves, which we have not, or which does not come from us; but it is a falſe Humility, it is Hypocriſy, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Graces of God in us,</p>
                  <p>It is objected; <hi>that ſome preſume much upon themſelves, that Man is very apt to flatter himſelf,</hi> and to this purpoſe, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are mentioned; <hi>who truſted in their own Righteouſneſs.</hi> To this I reply, That thoſe Preſumptuous Perſons are Hypocrite, who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96537:60"/>have no ſolid Piety. I ſay, that the Grace of God, beats down that Pride, and that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had nothing but an external Righteouſneſs, a deceitful and Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sanctity. It is therefore without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Men cry down Holineſs, and pretend that the Study of Good-works, begets Preſumption, becauſe there have been, and there ſtill are Hypocrites. If we may ſay where Pride is to be found; it is in thoſe wild and extravagant Moraliſts, who make all theſe Objections. Thoſe Men aſcribe very little to Good-works, and yet what Opinion do they not entertain of themſelves? They fancy themſelves God's Favourites, and the truly Humble Men; and all this by virtue of their ſtock of Confidence: And which is yet worſe, they judge raſhly of thoſe, who endeavour to live better than themſelves, and they make bold to call them <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Hypocrites. Is not this a moſt intolerable Preſumption and Boldneſs?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Abettors of Corruption inſiſt mightily upon this Maxim, <hi>That Exceſs in all things is to be condemned; and that Piety, when carried too far, degenerates into Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Hypocriſy.</hi> It is not only the Libertines ſpeak after this manner; many who would be thought Wiſe and Rational Men, uſe the ſame Language. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96537:60"/>to Vertue, they condemn Atheiſm and Impiety; but they likewiſe condemn thoſe who would tie Men to the ſtrict Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Duties of Holineſs. <hi>In all things,</hi> ſay they, <hi>a juſt Medium is to be obſerved.</hi> The worſt of it is, that ſome Moraliſts give an occaſion to theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the Pictures they make of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and Superſtitious Men. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as Men, who carry all the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Devout Perſons; they tell us that Hypocriſy goes beyond true Devotion; and they are not aware that by this, they turn Religion into ridicule, and render it odious.</p>
                  <p>This Maxim as well as the former, is founded upon the un-accurate Notions, which moſt People have concerning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; for it will appear to every Man who examines this Matter with ſome care; 1. That Piety can never be carried too far, and that we can never do too much in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and in complyance with our Duty. And, 2. That Piety, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition or Hypocriſy, are things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to one another: So that to imagine, that a diligent and earneſt application to Piety, leads Men to Superſtition, or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, is amonſtrous Abſurdity, and the higheſt Contradiction that can be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is juſt as if one ſhould ſay, that Gold or Silver by being very much refined,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96537:61"/>might at laſt degenerate into Lead, or Earth How or which way can Piety turn to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or Hypocriſy? This is a thing that cannot be conceived. As long as Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Reaſon upon true Principles, they may purſue them with aſſurance, and without fear of running themſelves into falſe or dangerous Conſequences. Men will never fall into Superſtition, or Hypocriſy, by the Practice of Vertue. So far from it, that the more true Piety a Man has, he will find himſelf at the greater diſtance from Superſtition and Hypocriſy: And a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Perſon is ſo far from out-ſtripping a good Man, that on the contrary he comes infinitely behind him. Solid Vertue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with theſe two Characters Firſt it is ſincere and from the Heart, and by that it deſtroys Hypocriſy, inſtead of producing it: And then Secondly, it is well-informed and Rational, it fills the Mind and Heart with true Notions, with great and elevated Views; and ſo it ſets Men at an infinite diſtance, from thoſe mean, ignorant, and trifling Things which the Superſtitious are taken up withal. Let us conclude then, that Hypocritical and Superſtitious Men, are ſo far from having too much Piety, that they have none at all. If it happens ſometimes, as it certainly does; that Men who have a ſound and honeſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96537:61"/>Heart, are ſomewhat given to an odd kind of Devotion, which in ſome reſpects ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Superſtition; this does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Piety it ſelf, but from a defect in thoſe that profeſs it, who may either want Knowledge, or force of Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Tho' Men endeavour to defend Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with thoſe Maxims I have related; yet as, theſe Maxims may eaſily be Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo they are ſometimes forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That the depravation of the Ag is great, and that the Life of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is not agreeable to the Rules of their Religion. But for all this, they do not give up the Cauſe. They betake themſelves to various Excuſes, by which they think to exempt themſelves from their Duty, or at leaſt, to leſſen and extenuate the Sin of not obſerving it. Theſe Excuſes muſt needs maintain them in Security; they are beſides very common, and even paſs frequently for good and juſt. Therefore I think it may be proper to Refute them too, in this Chapter. It would be a difficult Task, to reckon up all the Excuſes which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the behalf of Corruption, and to trace out all the doublings and artifices of Man's Heart, upon this Matter. It will be ſufficient to mention thoſe which are moſt general and ordinary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is cuſtomary to excuſe Corruption,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96537:62"/>by ſaying, <hi>That we are Men, and not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> This Excuſe might be deſtroyed by what has been already ſaid, but yet it may be uſeful to dwell a little upon it. It is ſaid then, <hi>That we are Men, and not Angels;</hi> and that is a moſt certain Truth; but there is no ground to juſtify or excuſe by that the ill Lives of Chriſtians. For firſt, that very thing that we are Men, obliges us to the Practice of Vertue, inſtead of exempting us from it. <hi>We are Men,</hi> and as ſuch, we have a Reaſon which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes us from Brutes, and a Conſcience which diſcerns between Good and Evil; we ought then to live according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Principles of Conſcience; and to do that which becomes the Nature of Man. <hi>We are Men,</hi> and by conſequence Mortal, we know we are not to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in this World; and knowing this, we muſt either think of another Life, or propoſe to our ſelves no other End, than that of Beaſts; which follow their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct while they live, and then die never to live again. <hi>We are Men,</hi> but we are not Independent, we have a Creator and a Maſter; and as we are endued beſides with Underſtanding, we are to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Actions before his Tribunal; it is therefore agreeable to the Nature of Man, to live like a Creature that depends
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96537:62"/>upon God, and that muſt be Judged. So that this Conſideration, <hi>that we are Men,</hi> is ſo far from excuſing, that it condemns Corruption.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid <hi>that we are weak Men.</hi> This is very true, our Nature is frail, and has beſides a ſtrong byaſs to evil. But God ſpeaks to us as to weak Men; he commands us nothing but what is proportioned, to that ſtate of Imperfection we are in. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this Excuſe does not at all become Chriſtians. To ſay <hi>we are weak Men,</hi> is to ſhew we have but little ſenſe of God's kindneſs towards us. We are not only Men, but we are Chriſtians too, and this quality raiſes us above the natural conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men; it makes us New Men and New Creatures. Why do we then forget the Glory to which God has exalted our Nature through Jeſus Chriſt? Why would we ſtill lie down under the burden of frail and corrupt Nature?</p>
                  <p>It is further ſaid, <hi>that we are not Angels.</hi> But neither is it neceſſary that we ſhould be ſo, to do that which God Commands us. When God gives us his Laws, he knows he gives them to Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are admirably ſuited to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition in this World. If we were Angels, God would give us quite other Laws, the Goſpel would be aboliſhed, and

                  <p>It is therefore a frivolous Excuſe in the Mouth of Corrupt Men, to ſay, <hi>That no Man is Perfect, and that we cannot attain to the Perfection, or to the State of the Bleſſed in Heaven;</hi> for this is to ſhift the Queſtion, becauſe that is not the Perfection which God requires.

                  <p>We may apply very near, the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that other Excuſe, <hi>That every body has his Faults:</hi> There are Faults which do not deſtroy Piety; and God is graciouſly pleaſed not to impute ſuch Faults to thoſe

True Chriſtians are free from ſuch Faults, and thoſe who are not free from them, are not true Chriſtians. If this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim, <hi>That every one has his Faults,</hi> is not thus explained; we muſt ſpeak no longer of Vertue and Vice; for this Excuſe will ſerve for all Sins, and acquit every Body. If a Man is given to Swearing, if he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, Paſſionate, or Falſe, if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Adultry, it is but ſaying, <hi>Every one has his Faults, and no Man is Perfect.</hi> Such Language from a Man full of vitious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits is unſufferable.

We muſt therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this Propoſition, in the ſenſe, and with thoſe reſtrictions I have obſerved, and then it may be uſeful to comfort Good Men, but it will never excuſe thoſe who are Vicious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men endeavour to excuſe themſelves, by laying the Sins they commit, upon the great Number and the Force of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>It is very hard,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to avoid Sin, we are ſo many ways drawn into it, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

                  <p>All theſe Excuſes are trifling, and ſome of them are impious. For, to begin with that which is borrowed from the Multitude and Strength of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is unreaſonable to imagine, that the number of Temptations is ſo great, that their force is irreſiſtible. Temptations are frequent, I Confeſs; but it is an Error to think, that there is nothing but Snares and Solicitations to Sin in the World. This would give us a ſtrange notion of God and of his Works, and in that Caſe Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be very Miſerable. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on the other hand, that the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and Solicitations to Good, are very common, eſpecially in relation to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom an infinite Number of Objects and Motives call back to God, and to their Duty. Even Temptations themſelves give them occaſions of doing Good. God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them <hi>abundantly with all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Life and Godlineſs;</hi> as we are told, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Certainly we are to preſume, that if God permits that Men ſhould here meet with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96537:66"/>Temptations and Opportunities of undoing themſelves, he offers them on the other hand, many Occaſions and Inducements to take care of their Salvation. So that the great Number of Solicitations to Good, does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſtroy the Excuſe which is taken from the great Number of Temptations.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it more reaſonable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Strength of thoſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such a Complaint is very unſeemly from Chriſtians, who are appointed to overcome the World, the Fleſh, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temptations. When all things, are well conſidered, it will appear; that it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves, in our own Negligence, and in the perverſeneſs of our Wills; that we ought to look for that, which makes Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſo ſtrong and too hard for us. They have no more ſtrength than we give them. St. <hi>James</hi> has decided this Queſtion in ſuch a manner as ſhould ſtop the Mouth of thoſe, who ſeek the cauſe of Evil any where elſe but in their own Hearts.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Every Man</hi> ſays he, <hi>is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and inticed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devil has no more Power over us, than Temptations have; For he can but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96537:67"/>tempt us. But yet we are apt to aſcribe to him a kind of Omnipotence, According to the Vulgar Opinion, one would think that the Devil, is the Author of all the Sins that are Committed; that he is every where, and that Men are but his Inſtruments, which he uſes at pleaſure. If this was true, Men were indeed to be pitied, and it would be ſome Excuſe to thoſe who live ill. The Scripture teaches us no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>But the higheſt pitch of Temerity, is to charge God and Providence with our Sins. Thus ſome Men are wont to, ſay, <hi>ſuch a thing comes to paſs becauſe God would have it ſo; and ſuch another thing did not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen becauſe it did not pleaſe God that it ſhould.</hi> When this Excuſe is made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Sin, it amounts to the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid of Blaſphemies; it lays upon God all the Evil that happens, and makes him the Author of it. For either this Excuſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing; or elſe it imports, that God is the Cauſe of what happens, and not we. This muſt needs be the meaning of it, becauſe Men pretend to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſaying, <hi>God would have it ſo.</hi> In a word, here is no middle way; either the Cauſe of Sin is in Man, or it is not. If it is in Man, he can accuſe no body elſe but himſelf; he cannot clear him ſelf by ſaying, God would or would not have it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96537:67"/>ſo. If the Cauſe of Sin be not in Man, he is diſcharged, and all the Evil lights upon God. It is an aſtoniſhing thing; that Men who believe God to be infinitely Holy and Juſt, can entertain ſuch thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Excuſe is often alledged, and it is fetched, from Common <hi>Practice, Cuſtom and Example.</hi> That which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done is thought to be Innocent or at leaſt Pardonable. But the Greatneſs and the Univerſality of Corruption excuſe no body: Cuſtom and Example cannot make any thing lawful which is bad. Where there is an expreſs Law, it is to no purpoſe to plead Practice to the Contrary. Cuſtom or Numbers exempt no Man from doing that which God Commands, and will never Protect him at the Day of Judgment. Cuſtom and Example are ſo far from excuſing Vice, that on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, this very thing that the Cuſtom is bad, ought to make Men ſenſible how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, to ſet about a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if Men think that Example and Cuſtom excuſe them, they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs yet much more excuſable, when they can alledge the Examples and the Sins of Good Men. The Libertines triumph here. <hi>To what purpoſe is it,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Holineſs ſo ſtrictly and to enforce it with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96537:68"/>ſuch ſevere penalties, when he ſee many Good Men follow a courſe, give oppoſite to thoſe Maxims, and to that exact Morality?</hi> But they ought to conſider that it is extream hard, or rather impoſſible, to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whether a Man is truly a good Man or not. We cannot be aſſured of this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we knew Mens Hearts, which belongs only to God. This Reflection does alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy defeat the Excuſe, which is borrowed from the Sins of Good Men. We frequently imagine the Perſon who ſins, to be a good Man, when he is but an Hypocrite, or an, Atheiſt. Indeed Piety and Charity require, that we ſhould think the beſt of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, eſpecially of thoſe in whom the Marks of ſolid Piety and Vertue appear; but neither Charity nor Piety obliges us to confound Vice with Godlineſs, or to call Evil Good. Sin is Sin, and ought to be condemned wherever we meet with it, and more particularly in thoſe, who paſs for better Men than others. When Men who ſeem to be Pious fall into ſuch Sins as are inconſiſtent with. Regeneration; we ought to think, that thoſe Men either give the Lye to their Character, and are not what we took them for, and then we may apply to them the Words of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. xxxiii, ver. 18. <hi>When the righteous turneth from his righteouſneſs, and committeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96537:68"/>he ſhall even die thereby;</hi> or elſe we muſt think, that tho' they have ſome Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is but weak as yet, ſo that they are not what they appear. To be but however we ought to be poſitive in this, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and the Sins of others, will excuſe no Man in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another very Common Evaſion, by which Men endeavour to excuſe the neglect and omiſſion of their Duty, is <hi>that they do not profeſs Devotion and Piety.</hi> This is the ordinary Plea of Men of Buſineſs, of Worldlings, of Young People, of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, of Military Men, and of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beſides in all Conditions. <hi>We do not pretend to Devotion,</hi> they cry, <hi>we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the World.</hi> And with this ſhift, they not only think themſelves excuſable for neglecting Piety; but they fancy they have a Right to neglect it, and that they do a great deal, if they obſerve ſome of the External Duties of it. One can hardly believe, that theſe Perſons are in carneſt, when they make ſuch an Excuſe. It aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a Man to find Chriſtians, who have the conſidence to ſay, That Piety is not their Buſineſs, that they are of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that they are not at leiſure to be Devout.</p>
                  <p>I fancy, there are Two Things which

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:96537:71"/>deceive thoſe who who alledge this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. 1. That they do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Devotion is; they look upon it as a very auſtere and ſingular way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; from whence they conclude, that but few People are able to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, and ſo they turn it over to the Clergy, to Women, or to thoſe who have much leiſure. I have obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the Falſeneſs of this Prejudice, and ſhewed that Piety is neither ſingular nor auſtere. 2. The other cauſe of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſeems to be this; that they do not conſider that Piety is every Bodies Buſineſs, and that ſuch is the nature of it, that it may be practiſed by all Men. Not but that ſecular Occupations and Callings, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſtruct Piety and ingage Men in Vice; and therefore a Chriſtian ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo taken up with the Affairs of this Life, as thereby to diſable himſelf from performing the Duties of Chriſtianity. But after all, a Man may live like a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in any lawful Calling; and in that ſenſe properly we are to underſtand the Words of St. <hi>Paul, That the Grace of God which brings Salvation, has appeared unto all Men, teaching them to live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godly, in this preſent World.</hi>

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:96537:71"/>
                  <p>Do thoſe who plead it for an Excuſe <hi>that they do not profeſs Devotion,</hi> imagine, that there are two ways to go to Heaven, the one for Devour, and the other for Worldly Men; the one narrow, and the other broad? Do they think that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God do not concern all Men, that there is reſpect of Perſons with God, or that he diſpenſes with his own Laws? How can they prove theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions? Are not we all Chriſtians? Have not we all been Baptize? Does not God give us all the ſame Laws? Or have ſome more reaſon to love God than others? And ought not the great Concern of our Salvation, to be equally dear to us all?</p>
                  <p>I grant that thoſe who have greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and more Leiſure than others; ought to make uſe of theſe Advantages: But I maintain at the ſame time: that none ſtand in greater need of Piety, than thoſe who ſay, <hi>we are engaged in the World, we do not pretend to Devotion.</hi> It is becauſe they are not Devout, that their Condition is very ſad; and the more they are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the World, the greater are the Temptations and Diſtraction, to which they are liable: Now he that is expoſed to a Storm, had need take more care, than he who enjoys a Calm.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal Maxims and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96537:72"/>Sentiments, which are made uſe of, to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize Corruption. Whoever takes notice of what is ſaid and done in the World, muſt needs acknowledge that theſe and the like Maxims are vented abroad every day; ſo that in order to obſtruct the Progreſs of Corruption, it is abſolutely, neceſſary to undeceive Men, in reference to theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and to oppoſe that Criminal Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſhamefully Corrups the Truths, of Reilgion and turns Impieties into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maxims and Articles of Faith.</p>

                  <head>CAUSE IV. The Abuſe of Holy Scripture.</head>
                  <p>IT is a daring piece of Confidence to Authorize Corruption with Maxims borrowed from Religion; but it is the laſt degree of Audaciouſneſs and Impiety, to turn the Holy Scripture to ſuch a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous uſe, and to ſeek in that Divine Book Pretences and Apologies for Vice; and yet the Extravagance and Temerity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad Chriſtians come up to this pitch. Several declarations of the Word of God, are made by them as many Maxims, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they think to ſhelter themſelves;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96537:72"/>and if we believe them, there is nothing either in their Practice or Opinions, but what is agreeable to the Will and Intentions of God himſelf. This Abuſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I deſign to ſhew in this Chapter, to be one of the Cauſes of Corruption; and it cannot he too ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſages of Scripture which are abuſed to this purpoſe, may be reduced to theſe Four Heads. The firſt comprehends the places which are, brought againſt the neceſſity of Good Works. Under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we will examine thoſe declarations of Scripture, by which ſome endeavour to prove, That all Men without exception, are in a ſtate of Corruption which ſubjects them to Sin. In the third place, we ſhall anſwer the Arguments drawn from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe Saints, whoſe Sins are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture. And laſtly, we ſhall make ſome Reflections upon thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in which the Divine Mercy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the greateſt Sinners</p>
                  <p>There are divers Paſſages in Scriptures, which being ill underſtood, lead many into this perſwaſion, That Good Works are not of abſolute Neceſſity. And Firſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more confidently alledged to this purpoſe, than what we read in many places;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. III. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are juſtified by Faith, and not by our</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:96537:73"/>
                     <hi>Works.</hi> No Doctrine is more clearly and expreſly delivered in the Goſpel, than that of Juſtification by Faith. But it is a Perverting of this Doctrine to conclude from it, that Salvation may be obtained without Good Works. This Concluſion muſt needs be falſe, ſince the Goſpel enjoyns Good Works as a neceſſary Condition in order to Salvation. St <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. XX. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> And does not that import, that none ſhall be ſaved without Holineſs and Good Works? The ſame Apoſtle teaches us, that at the Day of Judgment, when Men ſhall be admitted into, or excluded from Heaven; God will have a regard to their Works, to the good or evil which they ſhall have done<note n="|" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>God will render to every man according to his Works.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. V. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that we may receive according to what we have done, whether good or bad.</hi> This is very poſitive, and therefore ſince there can be no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Scripture, here is enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to Convince us that the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, has nothing in it which deſtroys the neceſſity of Good Works.</p>
                  <p>But it will appear yet leſs difficult
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96537:73"/>to reconcile theſe two Doctrines; if we ſuppoſe that which no Man can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Conteſt, namely, that when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, that Faith is ſufficient to Salvation, we are to underſtand by the word <hi>Faith</hi> in this Propoſition; that true Faith which the Goſpel requires. Now if we ask what that Faith is, and by what Marks it may be known? All the Apoſtles will unanimouſly tell us, that true Faith produces a Holy Life, and that it diſcovers it ſelf by all manner of Good Works. They aſſign Good Works as the eſſential Mark and Character, that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes a ſaving from an Hypocritical Faith. By that very thing therefore that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires Faith, it does likewiſe require Good Works, ſince Faith cannot be without Works. And by conſequence the Opinion of thoſe, who fancy that Faith is ſufficient without Works, is evidently abſurd, and contrary to the Goſpel, and to the Nature of Faith it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But to ſet this matter ſtill in a clearer light; it is neceſſary to take notice here of two Miſtakes, which Men are apt to run into when they ſpeak of Faith and Good Works. The firſt is, that they ſeparate Faith from Works; they look upon Faith as a thing quite different from Works, and which ſupplies the want of them; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they oppoſe Faith to Works, as if theſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96537:74"/>two things were contrary to each other A Corrupt Man will ſay, <hi>I confeſs that I have not Good Works, but however I have Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſpeak thus, ſuppoſe that they may have Faith tho' they have not Works; but St. <hi>James</hi> has directly confuted this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;<note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. II.</note> 
                     <hi>What does it profit, my Brethren, though a man ſay he has Faith and have not Works? can Faith ſave him? If Faith have not Works, it is dead, being alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can after this ſeparate ſaving Faith from Good Works? Can we ſeparate that from Faith, which God has declared to be inſeparable from it? It ſhews that Men are ſtrangely blinded With Ignorance and Prejudice, when at this time of day we are fain to prove things ſo plain and queſtionable.</p>
                  <p>The Second Illuſion is, that Men place Faith in Confidence alone, and many define it by that. They fancy that to have Faith, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to believe that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to rely upon the Merits of Chriſt, becauſe Faith embraces the Promiſes of the Goſpel, the natural effect of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to fill the Heart with aſſurance and tranquility. It is beyond all doubt that for the moſt part true Faith is attended with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96537:74"/>Confidence. But Confidence is not the Whole of Faith; and I cannot Imagine what part of God's Word countenances that Notion, which places the Eſſence of Faith in Confidence alone. The Faith which the Goſpel ſpeaks of, conſiſts in believing that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World; in embracing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as true, and in making Profeſſion of it, in doing his Commandments, and hoping for Salvation from him. But the reſolving all Faith and Religion into Acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, is the moſt extravagant Conceit that can enter into a Man's Head. If this Notion was true, it would follow from it, that in order to be ſaved, it is enough fore Man to believe that he ſhall be ſaved. Which is the ſame thing as to ſay, that whoever would have a right to confide in God needs do no more in order to that, than actually to truſt in him; and that is a moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Thought, which turns all Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtrong Fancy. Before we believe a thing we ought to know why we ſhould believe it, and have good reaſon and ſolid Grounds for our Belief. Before we truſt in God, we ought to ſatisfy our ſelves that we have a Right to confide in him; for can a Man be ſaved only becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground or reaſon he fancies that he ſhall? We ought not to rely upon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96537:75"/>God but according to his Promiſe. Now God has promiſed nothing to thoſe who live and are hardned in Sin; far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing any thing to them, he threatens them with inevitable ruin. What claim or title then can an obdurate Sinner have to the Mercy of God? What Confidence can he repoſe in God's Promiſes, as long as he continues impenitent? None at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we ſuppoſe in God a general Decree, to ſave indifferently all ſorts of Perſons.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be ſaid that theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are apt to Alarm and Diſturb the Peace of Men's Conſciences; for they will Alarm none of thoſe who are animated with true Faith and ſincere Piety. And as to others; we do them a great piece of ſervice, when we awaken and terrify them, out of that falſe Quiet, into which a groundleſs Confidence has betraied them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the other hand, it is a dangerous thing to teach, that Confidence is the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial thing to Faith; for by this we may alarm ſome good Men, who either through Melancholy or want of Inſtruction, are deſtitute of Confidence and inward Peace, And it has certainly happened, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pious Perſons are fallen into black Thoughts and ſad Scruples concerning their Salvation, and that they have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſponded, becauſe they did not find
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96537:75"/>Confidence, and a ſenſe of the love of God, in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe Reflections it does evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that Faith never ought, nor can be ſeparated from Good Works; and that Chriſtians are as much obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themſelves to Good Works, as they are to believe, and to have Faith.</p>

                  <p>Why has not than difference been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which St <hi>Paul</hi> makes about Works?

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96537:77"/>theſe two Apoſtles, ſome People find here great difficulties. They do not reconcile St. <hi>James</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but they rather refute St. <hi>James</hi> by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> is expounded with great Caution; as if he had gone too far by ſaying, <hi>that Man is juſtified by works, and not by Faith only.</hi> This Propoſition is ſoftned as much as poſſible, it is excuſed rather than explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as for what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<hi>that Faith alone juſtfiies without Works,</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the utmoſt ſtrictneſs; ſo that all is aſcribed to Faith, and nothing to Good Works. Nay Faith is ſet in Oppoſition to Good Works, and God to God himſelf; the Paſſages of Scripture which ſpeak of Faith being brought out againſt thoſe which relate to Works. <hi>It is true,</hi> ſay ſome, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays that without Holineſs no manſhall ſee God,</hi> but it is likewiſe written, <hi>that we are not juſtified by our Works, but only by Faith.</hi> And by this way of reaſoning, Men raiſe themſelves above the reproaches and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of their own Conſciences. I ſay it once more; this is to attack and confute the Word of God by it ſelf, and to charge the Holy Ghoſt with ſelf-contradiction. For in ſhort, if a Man can be juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Good Works, he can be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them too; ſince the being, juſtified is the ſame thing with the being ſaved: Now if a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96537:77"/>Man can be ſaved without Good Works, he may ſee the Face of God without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which is directly contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 21.14.</note> 
                     <hi>that without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A great many People imagine, that it is one of the Priviledges of Chriſtians, not to be tied to the Obſervation of God's Law as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; ſome miſtaken places give occaſion to that Error, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly this;<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>We are no more under the Law but under Grace.</hi> Theſe words are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. <hi>The Law did preſcribe Works, but the Goſpel requires only Faith; the Law did threaten, but the Goſpel ſpeaks only of Grace and Pardon. So that to require Works, at this time of day, is to bring back the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Law.</hi> There is ſomething of Truth in this reaſoning; but thoſe who make uſe of it, to free themſelves from the Obſervation of God's Commandments, do very little underſtand either what the Law or the Goſpel is, and wherein theſe two Diſpenſations differ. It is certain, that the Law was a Diſpenſation of Severity; it did not propoſe to Men remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation as the Goſpel does. The Law had not that power and efficacy to ſanctify Men, which Grace has. The Law
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96537:78"/>laid upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> great many Obligation which were not only burdenſom and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but which beſides had no intrinſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>But if from this, that we are not under the Law, we ſhould infer that we are no longer bound to do what is juſt, this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence would overturn the whole Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and transform Religion into Libertiniſm.

                     </gap> notice of two Errors, which are pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The Firſt is, the applying to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at this day, all thoſe things which were ſpoken of old by the Apoſtles, to the Converted <hi>Jews.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>that we are no more under the Law,</hi> and Chriſtians are often exhorted to bleſs God for being no longer, under the Curſe of the Law, and the Yoke of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And upon this a great many Oppoſitions are obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law and the Goſpel. For my part, I do not think thoſe Exhortations and Oppoſitions, ſo very proper to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, when we are ſpeaking to Men, who never were <hi>Jews;</hi> unleſs we do it with a deſign to ſhew the Excellency of the Goſpel-Covenant, above that of the Law, and the advantages of Chriſtians above <hi>Jews.</hi> For after all, the Law was given
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96537:79"/>only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubjected to the Ceremonies or the Curſe of it, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were. Why ſhould we then ſay to People who never were under the Law, <hi>You are no more under the Law?</hi> The Apoſtles indeed ſpoke in that manner to the Converted <hi>Jews;</hi> but as to thoſe who were formerly <hi>Pagans,</hi> it would be more fitting to tell them;<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſſ. 1.9. Epheſ. 11.12. &amp; 4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>You have been converted from Idols to the living God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ye were in times paſt Gentiles without hope, and without God in the World; and therefore live no longer like Heathens.</hi> It is a great fault not to expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to the true ſcope of it, and to apply all that it contains, to all ſorts of Perſons without diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The other Error is of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. People fancy that becauſe we are not under the Law, which was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Rigor, we are now to ſpeak of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to Men, but of Grace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and that it is contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, to threaten and to denounce Curſes againſt Sinners. It has been ſaid already, in what ſenſe the Law was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Rigor, in oppoſition to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; but the Goſpel has alſo its Curſes, and they are much more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96537:80"/>than thoſe of the Law. The Goſpel ſpeaks of the future Puniſhments of another Life, in much clearer and ſtronger Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than the Law does. To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of this, we need but reflect upon that oppoſition, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel, in the Tenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, He that deſpiſed Moſes Law died without mercy, under two or three Witneſſes; of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and has done deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace? We know him that has ſaid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, faith the Lord. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hand of the living God.</hi>

                     <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> concerning Chriſtian Liberty; when he declares that Chriſtians <hi>are freed from the bondage of the Law,</hi> when he exhorts them, <hi>to ſtand faſt in that Liberty,</hi> and proteſts, <hi>that Chriſt proſiteth nothing to thoſe, who would be juſtified by the Law.</hi> But a Man may ſee with half an Eye, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96537:80"/>means only, that Chriſtians are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bound to obſerve Circumciſion, and the other Ceremonies of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> That St. <hi>Paul</hi> has no other view or deſign but this, will plainly appear to every one who will read the whole Epiſtle, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the ſecond Chapter of it.</p>
                  <p>In the V Chapter we find two things which are deciſive in this Matter. 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks there expreſly of Circumciſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. V.</note> 
                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if you be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing; for I teſtifie again to every Man that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law.</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto yon, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> 2. It is very obſervable, with what circumſpection the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers himſelf, left his Doctrine ſhould be wreſted to favour Licentiouſneſs; after he had ſaid, <hi>You are called to liberty,</hi> he adds, immediately <hi>only uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi> He explains what he means by living after the Fleſh, by making an enumeration, of thoſe Sins which the Fleſh produces, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Men from the Kingdom of Heaven. He exhorts Men to live after the Spirit, and to practiſe the Chriſtian Vertues. In the

                     <hi>Fourth</hi> Chapter he purſues the ſame Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and he ends the Epiſtle with theſe remarkable Words, which contain the ſumm of his Doctrine;<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. VI. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but a new Creature;</hi> that is to ſay, Whether a Man be a Jew or a Heathen, it matters not ſo he believes in Jeſus Chriſt, and obſerves God's Commandments:<note n="†" place="bottom">ver. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Peace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be on them all who walk after this Rule.</hi> Is there anything plainer than this Doctrine? And yet how clear ſoever it may be, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty is alledged to ſet Men free from the Obligation to keep God s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. All that St. <hi>Paul</hi> fays againſt Circumciſion and the Ceremonies of the Law, is by an Enormous Blaſphemy, turned againſt the Holy Commandments of the Son of God. Can any thing more Odious or Prophane be imagined, than the perverting of the Holy Scripture at this rate?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe who plead on the ſide of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, are wont to object againſt what is ſaid in behalf of Holineſs, this Sentence of <hi>Solomon's,</hi>
                     <note n="|" place="bottom">Epheſ, VII. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>be not righteous overmuch, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make thy ſelf over-wiſe.</hi> And what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences do they riot draw from thence?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96537:81"/>They conclude from this Place, That a Man ought not to pretend ſo much to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or to ſet up for a good Man, and that in all things Mediocrity is beſt. One may eaſily apprehend that ſuch Sentiments muſt needs introduce Licentiouſneſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they are thought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee whether or no, ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits can be founded upon this Sentence of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. I ſhall ask in the firſt place, Whether it is poſſible for a Man to be too Juſt or too Wiſe, and whether there can be a vicious exceſs in Righteouſneſs or Wiſdom? If a Man may be over-righteous, he may likewiſe love God too much; for to be righteous, and to love God is the ſame thing. Now God requires that we ſhould love him with all our Heart, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that we ſhould be as righteous, as it is poſſible for us to be. But far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-righteous, we can never be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous enough. And if we can never be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous enough, is there any occaſion to exhort us, that we ſhould not be over-righteous? I wiſh Men had at leaſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for the Scripture, as not to make it ſpeak Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>I know the ordinary Evaſion: Vicious Men will ſay, that when Piety runs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it leads to Superſtition or Pride, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96537:82"/>becomes troubleſome and ridiculous. Every body ſays that, but without Reaſon. I have refuted that Opinion, and ſhewed that true Piety never degenerates into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or Pride, and that Devout Men who are Superſtitious, or troubleſome, have but a falſe Devotion, or a miſguided Zeal.</p>
                  <p>This may direct us to the true meaning of the Sentence in Queſtion; <hi>Solomon</hi> does not ſpeak here of true Juſtice and Wiſdom. For whether he may have an eye here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Superſtitious or Hypocritical Perſons whoſe Righteouſneſs is but imaginary, which Senſe is adopted by many Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or whether he ſpeaks of thoſe who exerciſe Juſtice with too much ſeverity, as ſome think; or whether as it is conceived by others, he gives this advice to buſy and preſumptuous People, who meddle in things which do not concern them, and fancy themſelves able to determine all Matters; however, it is plain, that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> does not ſpeak here of good Men, who exactly follow the Rules of true Juſtice and Wiſdom. If we ſtick to the laſt of theſe Three Expoſitions, which ſeems to agree beſt with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s deſign; then the meaning of this place is clear and rational, and has nothing in it contrary to Piety; whereas the ſenſe which is put upon theſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96537:82"/>Words by the Libertines, is both Abſurd and Impious.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who would either juſtify or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Corruption; uſe to object in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place; That ſince the Scripture teaches, that all Men, and even good Men are deeply ingaged in Corruption; it muſt follow from thence, that Holineſs and Good-works are not ſo very neceſſary, and that the practice of theſe is impoſſible. Now to prove this univerſal Corruption of all Men, they bring ſeveral Declarations of Scripture, and this among the reſt. <hi>There is not one that doeth good, no not one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>If their meaning in citing theſe Words, was only to ſhew, that there is no Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from Sin; and if it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other-hand, that good Men do not ſin in the ſame manner that the wicked do; I would not quarrel much about this Interpretation, tho' not altogether exact or agreeable to the ſcope of <hi>David</hi> in the 19th <hi>Pſalm.</hi> But there is another deſign in it, which is to inferr from theſe Words, that Men differ very little from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they are all guilty of many great Sins, and that none do, or can practiſe the Duties of Holineſs. In a word, this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Apology of Corruption, and to ſilence thoſe who oppoſe it.</p>

                  <p>If what <hi>David</hi> ſays in this place is to be ſtrictly underſtood, it will follow, that there is not one good Man upon Earth; that all Men are perverted, that they are all become abominable by their Sins, and that there is not one ſingle Perſon that is juſt or that fears God. But this Conſequence raiſes Horrour, it is contrary to Truth and Experience, and to what the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in a Thouſand places, where it ſpeaks of Good Men, and diſtinguiſhes them from the Wicked. Nay this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may be deſtroy'd from what we read in that very <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which mentions the Juſt who are protected by God, and the Wicked who perſecute them. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>David,</hi> muſt therefore be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with ſome reſtrictions.</p>
                  <p>By reading the XIV <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>David</hi> intends to deſcribe in it, the extream Corruption of Men in his time. There he draws the Picture of Impiety and Atheiſm, and ſpeaks of <hi>thoſe Fools who ſay in their hearts that there is no God,</hi> and whoſe life is a continued chain of Sins. It muſt be obſerved in the next place, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites theſe words out of the XIV <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> Chap. III. he does it with a deſign to ſhew, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not much better than the Heathens, and that they had as much
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96537:84"/>need of a Saviour.<note n="*" place="bottom">V. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>What then, are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they? No in no wiſe, for we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under ſin.</hi> This is the Aſſertion which St. <hi>Paul</hi> maintains, and which he proves from that complaint which <hi>David</hi> made of Old,<note n="†" place="bottom">V. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>There is not one that does good,</hi> &amp;c. From whence he concludes, <hi>that all mouths muſt be ſtopped, and that all the World is become guilty before God;</hi> ſo that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could neither juſtify nor ſanctifie the <hi>Jews.</hi> But he teaches at the ſame time, that Chriſt was come to reſcue Men out of that miſerable Condition. And it were a ſtrang thing if we muſt dill ſay of Chriſtians, <hi>that there is none that does good, no not one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This anſwer is to be applied to that place in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where it is ſaid,<note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. II. 1. i.</note> 
                     <hi>that we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> for to the ſame end theſe words are quoted. I do not deny but all Men abſtracting from the Divine Grace, are to be conſidered as dead in their Sins. That is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning in that place; he ſpeaks here of the Natural ſtate of Men, and particularly of Heathens; which was a State of Corruption and Death, in which they had periſhed had not God taken pity upon them. But the Apoſtle intends
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96537:85"/>to make the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſenſible, of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Mercy of God by which they were converted to Chriſtianity, being but poor Heathens before, who were dead in their ſins and obnoxious to the Wrath of God. He does not ſay to them, <hi>you are dead in your ſins;</hi> it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying the Text to cite it ſo, and to ſay, <hi>we are dead in our ſins;</hi> but, <hi>you were dead;</hi> he ſpeaks of the time paſt when they were Heathens;<note n="*" place="bottom">and 5. &amp;c,</note> 
                     <hi>Among whom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Jews, we had our Converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind;</hi> but now he adds, <hi>God has quickned us together with Chriſt; both you that were Heathens, and we that were Jews, are raiſed again from this ſpiritual death by virtue of God's great Mercy.</hi> This is the true meaning of that place, which gives us a lively Idea of Mens Natural Corruption, and of that happy State to which Chriſt has exalted them. I do not deny but that many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are ſtill in the ſame condition with Heathens, or very near it, being dead in their Sins, and following the courſe of this World; but this can be ſaid only of bad Chriſtians and not of thoſe who have felt the Divine and Sanctifying vertue of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:96537:85"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It will be further ſaid, that we muſt needs acknowledge, that all Men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception are Sinners, becauſe that is St. <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine,<note n="*" place="bottom">John. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves.</hi> This is a truth which no Man denies, becauſe it is too evident both from Scripture and Experience. But we muſt take care to underſtand this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition aright, <hi>that all men are ſinners,</hi> and that we explain it ſo, as that it may Comport, with that juſt difference we are to make between good and bad Men; elſe under a pretence that all Men are Sinners, the diſtinction between Virtue and Vice will be taken away. It is fit to remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, that the Scripture does not give the name of <hi>Sinners</hi> to all Men, but only to the wicked and impious, this may be ſeen in the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> When we ſay then, that we are all poor Sinners, we muſt know in what ſenſe we ſay it.</p>
                  <p>As to theſe words; <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin we decieve our ſelves.</hi> It is viſible that St. <hi>John</hi> ſays this upon two accounts, which relate to two ſorts of Sins, into which Men may fall. Firſt there are great Sins, there is that Corruption in which Men lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96537:86"/>their Converſion. In this regard St. <hi>John</hi> might ſay to thoſe he writes to, who were new converted Chriſtians, that they were all Sinners, meaning that they had all been ſo; for indeed both <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> had been extreamly Corrupt. Secondly, there are Sins, into which thoſe whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is not yet perfect, may fall; as Fhere are Infirmities from which the moſt regenerate Men, are not free. In this ſenſe all Men are Sinners, and the Chriſtians to whom St. <hi>John</hi> directs his Epiſtle, were all Sinners alſo, tho' already converted. But the queſtion is, whether a true Chriſtian ſins like other Men, and whether he who is a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> taking that word according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſe of Scripture, that is to ſay, one in whom Sin reigns, is a true Chriſtian: That can never be ſaid. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we may hear St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf in the III Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle; where he expreſly tells us, <hi>that he who is born of God does not commit Sin, that whoever ſinneth is of the Devil, and that by this we may know the Children of God and the Children of the Devil.</hi> Are not theſe words very plain? Who can have the confidence after this; to excuſe Corruption by ſaying we are all <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> But yet it is not only ſaid that we are all Sinners by theſe Men, but beſides, that we are all Great wretched and abominable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96537:86"/>It is no wonder that Men who have ſuch Sentiments, ſhould be ſo Corrupt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But to this, there is a reply at hand, to ſhew that the juſteſt Men are guilty of very frequent Sins, and it is taken from theſe words; <hi>The juſt man ſins ſeven times a day.</hi> I might let this alone, becauſe I am engaged only to anſwer thoſe Places of Scripture which are wreſted into an ill ſenſe about this matter. And this, that <hi>the juſt man ſins ſeven times a day,</hi> is no where to be found in the Bible. Thoſe who quote theſe words as if they were Scripture; will pretend no doubt, that they are contained. in <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiv. 16. But there is nothing like this in the Sacred Text. Theſe are the words of Solomon, <hi>a juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again: But the wielded ſhall fall into Miſchief. Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the frequent Afflictions of good Men, and particularly of the ill uſage they meet with, from wicked Men. In the 15 Verſe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to the wicked, and tells them, that it is in vain for them, to lay wait for, and to perſecute the Juſt, for, adds he, a <hi>juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again, but the wicked ſhall fall into Miſchief and periſh.</hi> The meaning is, that God takes care of the Juſt, and that if he permits that they ſhould fall into many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, he does likewiſe deliver them. This is aſſerted almoſt in the ſame words
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96537:87"/>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxvii. 24. <hi>Though the juſt fall he ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for the Lord uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with his hand.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe we are told, <hi>Job</hi> V. 19. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evil touch thee:</hi> This admits of no difficulty, and all Interpreters are agreed about it. And yet for all that, as men are apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain every thing, which excuſes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; this Proverb, <hi>That the juſt man ſins ſeven times a day,</hi> prevails, and paſſes for an Article of Faith. Is it not a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, that Men ſhould be thus obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent to wreſt the Scripture, into a ſenſe favourable to Corruption, and that they ſhould dare to falſify it at this rate?</p>
                  <p>There are many falſifyings in the way of citing this Paſſage. 1. Whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays only <hi>the juſt,</hi> he is made to ſay the <hi>juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man,</hi> to give the greater force and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to this Sentence, to debaſe Piety the more, and to inſinuate, that the beſt and holieſt Men, are great Sinners. 2. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is made to ſay, that the juſt <hi>Sins,</hi> but he does not ſay that, he ſays only that the juſt falls. I know that to <hi>fall,</hi> ſignifies ſometimes to <hi>ſin,</hi> but <hi>falling</hi> denotes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very frequently, <hi>to be afflicted,</hi> and a Man is blind who does hot ſee, that in this Text, the word <hi>fall</hi> is uſed in this ſecond ſenſe. The 17 Verſe which comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after that, which we are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96537:87"/>proves it beyond exception, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not when thine enemy falleth,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe who are acquainted with the Sacred ſtyle, know, that it does not uſually expreſs the Sins of infirmity, to which the Juſt are ſubject, by the word <hi>fall,</hi> that word importing commonly, the fall of wicked Men. 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> is made to ſay, <hi>That the juſteſt Man ſins ſeven times a day.</hi> This is another falſifying, an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Text, which is of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. <hi>Seven times a day,</hi> is not in the Text, there is only <hi>ſeven times.</hi> Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows that Seven times, ſignifies many times. And ſo the meaning would be, that the Juſt do nothing elſe but tranſgreſs; that many times a Day he falls into Sin. But who does not ſee, that this would be the deſcription of a Man in whom Sin reigns, and who is habitually ingaged in it, and not the Character of a good Man? I do not ſay, but that juſt Men have their weak ſides, and fall ſometimes into Sin; this happens more or leſs according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their Regeneration; but it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, to ſay, that their Life is ſpent in continual Sins, and that they offend God at every foot; and yet this is what Men would eſtabliſh from this Maxim, <hi>That the juſteſt Man ſins Seven times a day.</hi> Thoſe who have a mind to Quote the Scripture; ſhould neither add to, nor diminiſh from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96537:88"/>it, they ſhould not alter the Words, nor divide Sentences from what goes before and what follows; for otherwiſe there is no Abſurdity or Impiety, which may not be proved from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But our Adverſaries will ſay, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Place is alledged right or wrong, it does not matter much, ſince there are others which ſay the ſame thing, in ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Expreſſions. Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> VII.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. VII.</note> 
                     <hi>I am carnal ſold under ſin, for in me dwelleth no good thing; for that which I do I allow not: and what I would, that do I not; but what I hate that do I. I ſee a Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death!</hi> If St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks after this manner, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the greateſt Saints fall into very heinous Sins, and have ſtill a large ſtock of Corruption in them?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who draw this Inference from the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> make him ſpeak that which is quite contrary to his thoughts. He is ſo far from ſaying any thing that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the cauſe of Sinners; that on the contrary his deſign is to prove, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a good Life, and to make Men ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96537:88"/>of the Efficacy of the Goſpel in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Sanctification. He has this in his view, in the VII Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he repreſents the difference between a Corrupt and a Regenerated Man, and between the Condition of Man under the Law, and his State under the Goſpel. So that all he ſays of the Carnal Man ſold under Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be underſtood of a corrupt Man, living under the Law.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that Divines, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Able and Pious Men, have thought that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that he repreſents there, what paſſes within a Regenerate Man; but I know likewiſe that a great many Orthodox Divines, have rejected that Expoſition, as contrary to the ſcope of the Apoſtle, to the conſtant Doctrine of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion. It h a ſad thing that when a place is capable of two Senſes, Men ſhould pitch upon that, which comes nearer to the Pretenſions of Sinners. I do not intend here to enter into a Diſpute, nor to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe of a contrary Opinion; I am perſuaded that they have no deſign to countenance Corruption; but as in all things we ought to ſeek the Truth, and as the Truth here, is of great Conſequence for the promoting of Piety, ſo I entreat thoſe who might have Scruples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96537:89"/>thoſe Words, to make theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reflections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let them ſeriouſly and impartially conſider, whether it may be ſaid, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Carnal Man fold under Sin, a Man who did no Good but Evil, and a Man involved in Death; theſe are the ſtrongeſt Expreſſions which can be uſed, and which the Scripture uſes to give as the Character of Wicked and Impious Men: To believe this of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is ſo very hard, that a Man muſt be able to digeſt any thing, who is not ſtartled at it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I deſire them to attend to the Drift of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he had undertaken to ſhew, that the Doctrine of Juſtification by faith, did not introduce Licentiouſneſs; this he had proved in the whole VI Chapter, as may appear by the reading it. Is it likely that in the VII Chapter, he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all that he had eſtabliſhed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,\ and ſay, that the holieſt Men are captivated to the Law of Sin? If this be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, what becomes of the Efficacy of Faith to produce Holineſs, and how could he have anſwered that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he propoſes to himſelf, Chap. VI. 1. and 15. <hi>Shall we continue in ſin, ſhall we ſin, we that are under Grace? St. Paul</hi> ought to have granted the Objection, if it be true, that the moſt Regenerate, are ſold to Sin. But it is plain, that in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96537:89"/>VII Chapter he goes on to prove what he had laid down already, to wit, that the Goſpel ſanctifies Men, and not only this, but that the Goſpel alone can ſanctifie Men, and that the Law could not. This is the Scope of the whole Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the very firſt Four Verſes, he ſhews that <hi>Chriſtians are no longer under the Law,</hi> nor conſequently under Sin, <hi>and that they are dead to the Law, that they may bring forth fruits unto God.</hi> He expreſſes himſelf more clearly yet in the 5th Verſe, where he ſays, that there is a conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between thoſe who are under the Law, and thoſe who are in Jeſus Chriſt. He plainly diſtinguiſhes theſe two States, and the time paſt from the preſent. <hi>When we were in the fleſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the motions of ſin which were by the Law, did work in our Members to bring forth unto death, but now we are delivered from the Law, that we ſhould. ſerve in newneſs of Spirit.</hi> Theſe are the two States; The Sate paſt was a ſtate of Corruption, the preſect State is a State of Holineſs. But as it might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence, that the Law was the cauſe of Sin, the Apoſtle refutes that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, from the 7th to the 14th Verſe.</p>
                  <p>After this he deſcribes the miſerable Condition of a Man, who is not Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Grace, and who ſtill is under the Law. He begins to do this from the 14th Verſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96537:90"/>by faying, <hi>the Law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal ſold under ſin,</hi> &amp;c. And here no doubt it will be ſaid, that St <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, and not of thoſe who were under the Law; for ſays he, <hi>I am carnal,</hi> &amp;c. But one may eaſily ſee that the Apoſtle, uſes here a way of ſpeaking which is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in diſcourſe, and by which he that ſpeaks puts himſelf in the room of thoſe he ſpeaks of. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> had the more reaſon to expreſs himſelf in this manner, becauſe he had been himſelf under the Law, before he was converted to Chriſtianity. There are many inſtances in Scripture of this way of ſpeaking, and we find one in this very Chapter which is beyond excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the 9th Verſe; <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> &amp;c. If we do not admit here a figurative expression, or if theſe words are ſtrictly taken; then we muſt ſay that there was a time when this Apoſtle was without Law, which is both falſe and ridiculous. As therefore it is plain that when he ſays Ver. 9th. I was without Law, he ſpeaks of the State of thoſe Men to wliom the Law was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo it is unqueſtionalbe, that when he ſays, <hi>I am carnal,</hi> &amp;c. he deſcribes the State of a Corrupt Man living under the Law, and not his own. This is the Key which lets us into the meaning of his Diſcourſe, in which the Law is mentioned, almoſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Verſe.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:96537:90"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, That which makes it as clear as the Sun, that this is his true ſenſe, is, that when the Apoſtle conſiders and ſpeaks of himſelf as a Chriſtian, he uſes quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language. To be ſatisfied of this we need but run over, this Chapter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with other places in his Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>If he ſays here ver. 7, 8. <hi>That concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence is felt and reigns within a man who is under the Law;</hi> he declares Gal.

                  <p>Now let any Body judge, whether what is ſaid in this Chapter, can be applied to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> conſidered as a Regenerated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? Can it be ſaid, that Concupiſcence reigns in him who has crucifyed it? That Sin lives in him who is dead to Sin? That he who is not in the Fleſh; is a carnal Man? That he who is freed from Sin, is ſold to Sin? That no good thing dwells in thoſe in whom Chriſt dwells? That a Man is at the ſame time miſerable and happy, a Slave and yet delivered by Jeſus Chriſt, dead and alive? To ſay this, is it not to call Good Evil, and Evil Good; to put Darkneſs for Light. and Light for Darkneſs? Is it not to admit downright Contradictions in Scripture? But eſpecially, is it not to open a door to Licentiouſneſs, and to give us a

If he did perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Church then, it was through a blind Zeal and Ignorance; and for that reaſon, as he tells us himſelf, ver. 13. <hi>he obtained mercy from God.</hi> Is not this quite another Caſe, than that of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who knowingly and wilfully allow themſelves in Sin.</p>
                  <p>It is another miſtake to make St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, as ſome do, <hi>that he is the greateſt of Sinners;</hi> he does not ſay that, he ſays on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that he is the chief or the firſt of thoſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners whom Jeſus Chriſt did ſave.</hi> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he holds the firſt rank among converted Sinners, that he is a remarkable Inſtance of the Divine Mercy, and that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had begun by him, to ſhew his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96537:95"/>and Goodneſs, Thus he explains himſelf Verſe 16. <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> ſays he. <hi>I obtained Mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to them which ſhould hereafter believe on him.</hi> This is exactly what he meant; for as to what ſome imagine, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> out of Humility, acknowledges himſelf the greateſt of all Sinners; I think that expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is wrong, and that it neither agrees with Truth nor Piety, nor good Senſe. A good Man is not bound to think himſelf worſe than the greateſt ſinners; on the contrary, he ought to bleſs God, for that Good which the Divine Grace has wrought if him.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The Promiſes and Inſtances of God's Mercy, are frequently alſo taken in a ſenſe which favours Corruption and Security. All that the Goſpel ſays upon this head, is interpreted by vicious Men, as if the Son of God was come into the World, to give Men a licenſe to ſin. To this purpoſe the Inſtances of that Woman who was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of <hi>Zacheus</hi> and the converted Thief, are often alledged; as likewiſe the Parable of the Prodigal Son, of the Publican, and of the Labourers: And from theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well, as from our Saviour's Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 11.13.</note> 
                     <hi>that he is not come to call the righteous, but Sinners to Repentance;</hi> it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the greateſt Sinners may obtain Salvation, as well as the Juſt. But if thoſe who quote theſe Inſtances, did narrowly examine them, they would read in them, their own Condemnation. For firſt, all theſe Sinners mentioned in the Goſpel, did
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96537:97"/>repent and were Converted. That Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been a Notorious Sinner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the moſt lively Sorrow; the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. ſmites his Breaſt, the Prodigal comes to himſelf again, and deteſts his former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; <hi>Zacheus</hi> if he was an unjuſt man, reſtores fourfold. From theſe Inſtance we may very well infer, that God never rejects returning ſinners. But even this, is an invincible Argument, that there is no mercy for thoſe, who perſiſt in their Sins and that too in hopes of Pardon.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we muſt know that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's deſign in all theſe Parables and Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was to inform Men that he was come to invite the greateſt Sinners to Repentance and eſpecially to let the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand that for all the high opinion they had of their own Dignity and Merit, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens who lived in the greateſt Corruption were to be admitted into God's Covena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and to have a Share in his favour. Which actually happened to all thoſe Heathens who did believe in Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Parables then repreſent the Stare Men were in at that time, and not the State of thoſe, who are entred already into the Chriſtian Church. It can never be ſaid too much, nor remembred too often in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Goſpel; that there is a vaſt difference, between thoſe Heathens, who never heard a word of God or Jeſus Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:96537:97"/>and Chriſtians who are born in the Church and live in the Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>Thus I think I have examined thoſe Places of Scripture, which are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abuſed by the Libertines. If I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any, I hope what has been ſaid in this Chapter, may ſerve to ſuggeſt pertinent and ſatisfactory Anſwers to them.</p>

                  <p>COrruption is not wholly to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Ignorance, or to thoſe Prejudices and looſe Opinions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among Chriſtians. For men do not always ſin through want of Knowledge, or out of mere Wantonneſs and Libertiniſm. There are many who acknowledge the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of the Age, and the neceſſity of a good life; and yet they neglect their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intirely, or at leaſt they are very remiſs in the doing of it; acting for the moſt part, againſt their own perſuaſions.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be then other Springs of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Men, beſides thoſe which we have hitherto diſcovered. It is neceſſary to ſearch into theſe, and to find out, if poſſible, why many perſons, who want no Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96537:98"/>and are ſolicited by the Motion of their own Conſciences, to embrace the ſide of Vertue and Piety, do not withſtanding continue in Vice and Corruption.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to proceed chiefly from two Diſpoſitions, which Men are commonly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>On the one hand they are reſtrained by an ill Shame, from acting ſuitably to the ſentiments of their own Conſciences; and on the other hand, they put off their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, hoping that they ſhall one Day make up all the Irregularities of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, by Repentance. I look upon theſe two Diſpoſition, as two of the principal Cauſes of Corruption, and therefore I thought in might be proper, to conſider them both diſtinctly. I deſign to treat of <hi>falſe Modeſty</hi> in this Chapter, and to ſhew, 1. The Nature, and 2. the Effects of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>falſe Modeſty,</hi> I mean that Shame, which hinders Men <hi>to do</hi> that which they know to be their Duty. I call this Shame vicious or illl, to diſtinguiſh it from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of Shame, which is good and commendable, which conſiſts, in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to do ill things. If <hi>falſe</hi> Shame is a ſource of Corruption; that other Shame which reſtrains from Evil, is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Vertue, and a Preſervative againſt Sin; And therefore it ought to be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheriſhed and maintained, as vicious Shame ſhould be avoided or ſhaken off.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96537:98"/>For as ſoon as the ſenſe of this commendable Shame is gone, Innocency is irrecoverably loſt. It is a part of the Character of Sinners in Scripture, that their Wickedneſs raiſes no bluſhing or confuſion in them.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, that this falſe Shame, keeps Men from doing at the ſame time what they know and approve to be their Duty; and it is under that Notion particularly, that I am to conſider it here. It is not my deſign to ſpeak of that Shame, which ariſes from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or Contempt, and which is to be met with in thoſe profane and worldly Men, who becauſe they do not know Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or judge it unworthy of their Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, think it a diſgrace to follow its Maxims. I refer ſuch Men to the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, and to ſome further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which I am to inſiſt upon elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Shame I ſpeak of at preſent, ſuppoſes ſome Knowledge in the Mind, and ſome value for, and inclination to Piety. From whence it appears, how dangerous the Effects of that Shame, are, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant it is to know and obſerve them; ſince it ſeduces and corrupts even thoſe who are none of the worſt Men, and of whom otherwiſe, we might reaſonably hope well</p>
                  <p>Now to apprehend the Nature of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Shame; it muſt be obſerved, that Shame commonly ſprings from two Cauſes;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96537:99"/>Sometimes it proceeds from the Nature of the thing we are aſhamed of, or from the Opinion we have of it: Thus Men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of things, which either are, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear diſhoneſt in their Nature. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Shame is an effect of the regard we bear to other Mens Judgment, and then we are aſhamed to do things which may bring Contempt upon us, and Diſgrace us in the World. One may ſoon perceive that the Shame that is vicious does not ariſe from the firſt of theſe Cauſes. Religion has nothing in it, that is ſhameful arid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt; for far from that; it is of all things the moſt Comely and Honourable, and the moſt worthy of a Man; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuch, even to thoſe, who by reaſon of a groundleſs Shame, dare not practiſe the Rules of it. The true Cauſe then of this falſe Modeſty, is a feeble regard to Mens Judgment, and a fear of falling under their Contempt or Hatred. Piety is little Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the World, it is deſpiſed, and, it is hated; and theſe are the three principal Cauſes of vicious Shame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Piety is little Practiſed in the World; few People love or practiſe it. Now a Man is very inclined to do that which is commonly done; he thinks it is ſafeſt and moſt honourable, to ſide with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; he is afraid of making himſelf Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, by being ſingular. It is a Maxim
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96537:99"/>generally received, That we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Cuſtom, and to do as others do. The Reaſon then why many have not the Courage to be on the Side of Religion, is becauſe that Side is deſerted and abandoned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Piety is often deſpiſed in the World. It is looked upon as a mean and diſgraceful thing. The ſtrictneſs of a Man, who Acts upon Principles of Religion and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is imputed to weakneſs of Mind, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Humour, or Caprice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Hypocriſy and Pride. Thoſe who profeſs Devotion and Piety, are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ridicule: And on the contrary, it is thought honourable to comply in every thing, with the Ways and Faſhions of the Age. Tho' theſe Sentiments are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, yet they make a great Impreſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few People have Firmneſs enough to ſlight the Judgment and Contempt of Men. We have naturally a quick ſenſe of Honour, and nothing is ſo unſupportable to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, as Contempt; ſo that this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is dangerous, and it eaſily produces in a Man a falſe Shame, which diverts him from Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Piety does likewiſe procure the Hatred of the World; becauſe a good Life accuſes, condemns, and reproaches thoſe who live ill. Beſides, Religion obliges us ſometimes to do things, which diſpleaſe and offend Men. How cautious ſoever it may
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96537:100"/>be, it is much, if upon many occaſions, it does not ſtir up their Jealouſy, their Hatred, or their Spleen. A good Man is often bound to refuſe what is deſired of him. He is unacquainted with the Maxims of that mean and fawning Complaiſance, which is neceſſary to get every bodies Love. Many for this Reaſon neglect Piety. They dare not let ſhine a Light, which diſcovers the Weakneſſes and Errors of others; and Fear and Shame together make them think, that it would be Ill-breeding, as well as a piece of Imprudence, to follow a Courſe of Life which might render them odious.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Conſiderations it appears already, that this Shame is one of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fountains of Corruption, and that it can produce none but very ill effects; firſt upon thoſe in whom it is, and next upon other Men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The natural Effect of vicious Shame, is to diſſuade a Man from his Duty, and to draw him into Sin. It makes his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge uſeleſs, it fruſtrates the warnings which his Conſcience gives him; and ſo it extinguiſhes in him the Principles of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Thoſe who are poſſeſſed with this Shame, dare neither Speak nor Act as they ought, they diſſemble their true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they offer violence to their Conſciences, they have not the Courage to ſpeak the Truth, or to reprove their Neighbours,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96537:100"/>when occaſion requires; they are loath to confeſs, or to amend their Faults; in a Word, they frequently neglect the moſt indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duties of Piety and Charity: And all this becauſe they are checkt by a falſe Shame.</p>
                  <p>But if this Shame hinders us to do Good, it does as forcibly prompt us to Evil: As ſoon as a Man thinks it a diſgrace to do Good, and to diſtinguiſh himſelf by a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Deportment; he preſently conceives likewiſe, that it would be a Shame to him, not to imitate the Irregularities of others. Hence it is that we applaud Sin, that we are carried away by the Solicitations, or Examples of Perſons of Authority; that we cannot withſtand the Entreaties of Friends; that we ingage in unjuſt Enterprizes, or criminal Diverſions, and that we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many other wicked Practices. A very little Reflection upon our ſelves, will eaſily convince us, that Shame produces all theſe Effects. A Heathen Author<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch</note> has proved long ago, in an Excellent Tract, That falſe Modeſty is one of the greateſt obſtacles to Vertue; and that Men commit many Faults and bring a great deal of Miſchief upon themſelves, only becauſe they dare not refuſe to comply with others.</p>
                  <p>The effects of this Shame are not leſs fatal in reſpect of other Men. As it proceeds from the regard we bear to their Judgments,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96537:101"/>ſo it uſually ſhews it ſelf in their company; ſo that we cannot but ſcandalize and corrupt them, when we govern our ſelves by the ſuggeſtions of this falſe Shame. For not to mention here the Scandal which this gives to good Men; thoſe very Perſons, for whoſe ſake we uſe ſuch ſinful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and who deſpiſe Religion; conceive yet a greater Contempt of it, when they ſee, that thoſe who ought to ſupport its intereſt, are aſhamed of it, and dare not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſs it. They judge that Piety muſt be indeed, a very mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thing; and when they obſerve that Men are afraid to diſpleaſe them, they take ſuch an Aſcendent over them, that Vertue dares no more appear in their preſence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſuch an Indulgence towards Vice, gives a new force to it. If vicious Men are not reproved, it confirms them in their ill Habits; if they are imitated, they are Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized; if we are aſhamed to confeſs our Faults before them, we do not heal the Scandal which we have given them, and that is the greater for having been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Men who are thought Pious, and not by Libertines. But that we may be the more ſenſible of the pernicious effects of this kind of Shame, we ought to take notice of three things, which are very remarkable in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shame is a thing which has an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96537:101"/>power over a Man. Other Paſſions may more eaſily be reſiſted; but when Shame has gained an Aſcendent over the Mind, it is extream hard to be conquer'd, eſpecially if it proceeds from the regard we have for Men; for when it ariſes from a natural diſpoſition, it may ſooner be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The greateſt Threats and Promiſes will not ſometimes ſhame a Man, who will preſently yield if Shame can be excited within him. How often do we find the moſt vigorous efforts we can make upon our ſelves, and our beſt Reſolutions quite daſhed, by a filly baſhfulneſs? A Jeſt, a bare Look, or a ſlight Apprehenſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought ridiculous, or a Bigot, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enough to Confound us, and to make all our good purpoſes vaniſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ought to be conſidered; that the Shame we ſpeak of here, reſtrains thoſe Perſons, who in their Hearts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Vertue; thoſe who live in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ignorance, or in a total Obduration, being not ſuſceptible of this Shame. It ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as has been ſaid, ſome remainder of Conſcience and Knowledge ſoliciting Man to his Duty; but it overcomes that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and thoſe good Sentiments. We are to impute to this vicious Shame, a great part of the Sins of good Men; and this is one of the Articles upon which they have moſt reaſon to reproach themſelves; as is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96537:102"/>well known to thoſe who make any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon their Conduct. And if this Shame is able to ſpoil thoſe who other wiſe are Virtuous, and to extinguiſh their Zeal and Piety; we ought to reckon it among the Principal Cauſes of Corruption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Shame may lead men to the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Wickedneſs. For beſides that a man ſins againſt his Conſcience, when for fear of Men he dares not do his Duty; beſides that he offends God in a very provoking manner, when he is aſhamed to obey him, and fears Men more than Him; I ſay that this ſhame is apt to betray him into the great eſt Enormities. A man is capable of every thing when he becomes a Slave to other mens Judgment, and when Complaiſance or Humane Conſideration, have a greater force upon him, than the Laws of Religion, and his Duty. Whenever a man dares not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear good, he dares appear in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wicked. And when he ties to Vertue an Idea of Honour to Vice, and from complying in every thing with the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of looſe and profane Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Men do not arrive of a ſudden at this degree of Corruption; falſe Shame carries them to it by little and little. It makes one ſin at firſt through Compliſance, tho' with ſome Reluctancy. By this, Conſcience grows weaker; a man contracts the Habit of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96537:102"/>ſlighting its Suggeſtions, and Vice becomes more familiar to him. Then he begins to ſin more boldly; the ſhame of doing good increaſes, and the ſhame of ſinning grows leſs. In a little time he comes to do out of Cuſtom and Inclination, what he did before but ſeldom, and with ſome inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. From thence he proceeds to an open contempt of Piety, and ſo he forſakes an Intereſt to which he was well affected at firſt, but which this ſhame has made him diſlike. Thus many Perſons, who had good diſpoſitions in their youth; being let looſe into the World, have loſt their Innocence, and are turned Libertines and Atheiſts.</p>
                  <p>Now this falſe Modeſty being ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious we can never labour too much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its ill effects. And this we ſhall ſucceed in, if we ſeriouſly conſider, that there is a great deal both of Error and Cowardice, in the ſentiments and conduct of thoſe, who are hinder'd by ſhame, from diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duties of Religion and Conſcience. Firſt, there is a great deal of Error in their Proceding. This Shame is founded upon nothing elſe, but the Judgment which the World makes of Piety. But if thoſe who deſpiſe Religion are in the wrong, as they moſt certainly are; if it is Extravagance and Folly in them, to paſs a falſe Judgment upon Piety; it is a much greater Madneſs in thoſe who underſtand better Things,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96537:103"/>to ſubſcribe to a Judgment which they know to be Falſe and Erroneous, and to make that the Principle of their Actions. If Vertue is a Thing that is Good, Juſt, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Acceptable to God, and Uſeful to thoſe who Practiſe it; if with it we cannot fail of Happineſs, and if without it there is nothing but Dread and Terror; why ſhould we be aſhamed to give up our ſelves to it? A Wiſe Man ought to eſteem that, which deſerves Eſteem, and if Ignorant and Corrupt People are of another Mind he ought to ſet himſelf above their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to deſpiſe the Contempt of the ſenſeleſs Multitude. The Judgment of Men cannot make that Juſt which is Unjuſt, nor ſuperſede the Neceſſity of what is Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſo that it ſhould be of no weight in ſo important a Concernment, as that of our Salvation. Our Happineſs is not to be Decided by Man's Eſteem, or Contempt and the Approbation of God and our Conſcience, is infinitely to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their groundleſs Opinions.</p>
                  <p>But if there is ſo much of Error in vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Shame, there is likewiſe a great deal of Cowardice in it. Nothing is more baſe and unworthy, than for a Man to deſert the Intereſt of Vertue, when he is ſollicited by his own Conſcience to adhere to it. Not to have Reſolution enough to do his Duty in ſuch a Caſe, is on the one hand to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96537:103"/>his Reaſon and Conſcience to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of others, and to depreſs himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>on the other it is to have greater Regard for Men than for God. And is there any thing more abject than this Proceeding. Is not this ſhameful Cowardiſe in a Chriſtian, who is called to profeſs openly his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Faith, and who ought to think it his Glory, to maintain the Cauſe of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Juſtice, in ſpight of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Contempt of the Age? That Threatning which our Saviour has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe, who ſhould not have the Courage to embrace the Chriſtian Profeſſion, or ſhould abandon it, belongs alſo to thoſe mean-ſpirited Chriſtians we are now ſpeaking of.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. VIII. 38.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt and chief Remedy, againſt this falſe Shame, is then to be poſſeſſed with the following Reflections. Before all things to have a right Apprehenſion of the Certainty and Importance of Religion; to conſider that it propoſes to us infinite Rewards, but that thoſe Rewards are reſerved only for thoſe, who have the Courage to obſerve its Precepts; to think what Pleaſure and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96537:104"/>it is, to be approved of God and of one own Conſcience; To fix deeply this great Truth in our minds; that Mens Judgment is very inconſiderable; that our Felicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends neither upon their eſteem nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and to remember that the Scripture calls the Men of the World Fools, and that a time will come, when <hi>Shame, Confuſion and Miſery,</hi> ſhall fall to the Lot of thoſe Deſpiſers of Religion, while<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. II.</note> 
                     <hi>Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Peace ſhall be to every one that does good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhall eaſily conquer this Shame if we conſider, that the Danger of incurring Mens Contempt or Hatred by doing our Duty, is not always ſo great as we may imagine. I confeſs Piety is often deſpiſed; but yet it frequently commands Reſpect Even thoſe who think it ſtrange that their Example ſhould not be followed, cannot help having a ſecret eſteem and veneration for good Men. When Zeal is accompanied with Meekneſs and Diſcretion, there is no fear that a Man ſhould make himſelf odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ridiculous by practiſing Vertue. A Chriſtian Deportment, is ſo far from expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Men always to the Contempt of the World; that on the contrary it frequently happens, that thoſe who would avoid this Contempt, by neglecting their Duty, do thereby bring it upon themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:96537:104"/>
                  <p n="3">3. There might be yet another Remedy againſt this Vicious Shame; and that is the Example of Men of Authority. Whatever they approve or do, is reputed Honourable in the World; and on the other ſide, what they deſpiſe or neglect, is thought mean and diſgraceful. It would therefore be an eaſy thing to them, to correct the Notions which Men commonly have of Religion. As ſoon as they ſhall love and honour it; other Men will no longer be aſhamed of it, but will place their Glory in practiſing it. This I am to inlarge upon in the ſecond Part of this Treatiſe.</p>

                  <p>I Do not know whether any Illuſion is more Ordinary, or contributes more to the ſupport of Vice in the World, than that which I deſign to attack in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>er, and that is the Delaying Repentance. We muſt not believe that Men are ſo blind and ſo hardened, as never to think of their Salvation. There are few who have not a general Intention to obtain it. Even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mong thoſe who live ill, many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that Converſion is neceſſary, and that they are not yet in a ſtate of Grace. If it
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96537:105"/>be asked why then they do notrepent? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſo unreaſonable a Proceeding, which ſeems ſo contradictory to it ſelf; ought to be imputed to the hope they entertain, of clearing all ſcores one day by Repentance; and of obtaining the Pardon of all their Sins, through the Divine Mercy. This is the true Cauſe of the greateſt part of thoſe Sins which are committed in the World. It is that deceitful Hope which fruſtrates all the endeavours that are uſed, to make Men for ſake their Vicious Habits. The delay of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ought therefore to be placed among the Cauſes of the bad lives of Chriſtians; and the importance of this Subject, has made me reſolve to beſtow a particular Chapter upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now to handle this matter right, we are to obſerve two different ways of putting off Converſion; for all Men do not delay it in the ſame manner, and the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſpoſitions ought not to be ſuppoſed in them all. Some put it off to a remote time, and to the very end of their Lives. Others do not adjourn it ſo long; they deſign to go about it a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death; at leaſt they hope ſo; and they put it off to an undetermined time. The firſt, ſin properly in hopes of Pardon, but the others ſin, in hopes of Repentance. The former deceive themſelves more groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, they think that in order to be ſaved,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96537:105"/>it is enough to beg for Mercy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent tho' never ſo late; the Illuſion of the others is more ſubtil, they conceive it is neceſſary to reform and to forſake ſin; but for all that they do not Convert themſelves. Tho' theſe two ways of delaying have an affinity with one another, and might in a great meaſure be encountered with the ſame Arguments, yet I ſhall conſider them here ſeparately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Men commonly entertain this Opinion, That if they do but Repent at the end of their Lives, their Sins will be no hindrance to their Salvation. They allot for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Approaches of Death, Old-Age, or the time of Sickneſs; and they ſuppoſe that then, they ſhall fit themſelves for a Chriſtian Death, by Confeſſing their Sins, and having recourſe to the Divine Mercy. It is not, I think, needful to prove, that this Opinion is very common, for who can deny it? Neither will I go about to ſhew that it feeds Corruption and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages Security, by propoſing to Men ſuch a method of Salvation, as leaves them at liberty to live ſtill in Sin; for that is ſelf-evident. It is more important to let Men ſee how falſe and dangerous an Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is, which makes them believe, that ſo they Repent before Death, they ſhall avoid Damnation and be Saved. In order to this, we muſt endeavour to diſcover the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96537:106"/>Principle they Act upon, and to unfold the true Sentiments of their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>The delay of Repentance includes Two different Motions; the one carries a Man towards Salvation, and the other towards Sin. On the one had Man is neither ſuch an Enemy to himſelf, as to be altogether unconcerned about his Salvation, nor ſo as blind not to perceive that Repentance is neceſſary. On the other hand, he is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to his Luſts, that he cannot reſolve to renounce them. In perplexity, Self-love finds him out an Expedient by which he things to reconcile with his Appetites, the care of his Salvation. And that is, that if he ſins yet he intends to Repent.</p>
                  <p>But here it is manifeſt, that this Man puts a Cheat upon himſelf, and that ſuch Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceed only from ſelf-love, and from a ſtrong affection to Sin. Nothing elſe but the abſolute neceſſity of Dying, and, of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Account to God obliges him to deſtin the end of his Life to Acts of Repentance. For it cannot be ſaid, that the Love of God and of Vertue has any ſhare in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Is it any love or regard to God, that makes a Man deſire him in his laſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when he can enjoy the World no longer? This ſhews that a Man thinks of God only becauſe he expects Salvation at his Hands; which is to deal with him as with an Enemy, to whom we ſurrender
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96537:106"/>our ſelves as late, and upon as good Terms as we can, and only that we may not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Such a Delay includes a poſitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to offend God, and to gratify one's Paſſions, at leaſt for the preſent. He that thinks to Repent hereafter, is not willing to Repent now. He allots the preſent time for the ſatisfying of his Luſts, and for the committing of thoſe Sins, which are to be the matter of his future Repentance. This is all that is fixed and certain in his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for as to what he promiſes for the future it is moſt uncertain; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the thing right, he promiſes nothing at all, for he does not know, whether he ſhall not die very ſoon, nor what he ſhall do, in caſe he lives ſometime longer.</p>
                  <p>The Hazard to which a Man expoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by this Delay, is evident. In order to a compleat Repentance, Two Things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. The firſt is to have Time and Opportunity to Repent; the ſecond is, to make uſe of that Time and Opportunity. Thoſe who put off their Converſion to the laſt, Muſt ſuppoſe that they ſhall have theſe two Advantages. But theſe things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly uncertain, and no Man in the World can be ſure of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Man can promiſe himſelf, that he ſhall have Time and Opportunity to Repent at the end of his Life. It is true in fact, that more than one Half of Mankind, die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96537:107"/>having time to prepare for Death. If we reckon up all thoſe who are ſnatched away in an Inſtant by unforeſeen Accidents, or a ſudden Death, all thoſe who periſh in War, all thoſe who are ſeized with Diſtempers which take away their Senſes, all thoſe whom the Approaches of Death do not move to Repentance, becauſe they do not apprehend themſelves in any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dying; And if we add to theſe, thoſe whoſe only Preparation is to have a Miniſter to pray by their Bed-ſide, when they can hardly hear a few Words of what he ſays. It is certain that all theſe together, make up above the Half of Mankind. Upon this I ask, even ſuppoſing that it were time enough for a Man, to Repent when he ſees Death coming, whether it would not be Folly and Madneſs, for him to venture his Salvation upon the hope of repenting then.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to many, that it is the way to drive Sinners into deſpair, to tell them they ought not to build the hope of Salvation, upon what they ſhall do in the Extremity of Life. But what I have ſaid juſt now proves evidently, that if Salvation did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the manner of dying, Men muſt live in continual Fears, and in a kind of' Deſperation; ſince their Salvation would depend upon a thing, which the Half of Mankind cannot reckon upon. On the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96537:107"/>contrary nothing is more comfortable to Men, than to know that God grants them their whole Lives to work out their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in; and that if they improve to that purpoſe the Leiſure and Conveniences they have, their Death will be happy, which way ſoever it may happen. But tho' what I have ſaid were not true, and tho' all might aſſure themſelves that they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Approaches of Death, and have time to prepare for that laſt Paſſage; yet what certainty have they, that they ſhall make uſe of that Opportunity, and that their Converſion will not be moſt difficult, if not impoſſible? Converſion is not wrought, without God interpoſing, by thoſe Means which Grace uſes for that end. And can any Man flatter himſelf with the Hope, that theſe Means ſhall be offered him to the laſt, and that God in his juſt Anger will not withdraw them from him? There is neither particular Revelation, nor General Promiſe, to give ſuch Aſſurances to any Man living. So far from it, that God tells us many things in Scripture, which leave no ground for Hope, to thoſe who abuſe his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But further, What can we imagine that God will do in favour of a hardned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at the time of Death? When God has made uſe of the Preaching of his Word; of Exhortations, Promiſes, Threatnings,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96537:108"/>inward Suggeſtions and Motions of his Grace; when God, I ſay, has uſed all theſe Means, for Twenty, Thirty, or Forty Years, without any ſucceſs: I cannot Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what Men expect that he ſhould do more, at the Hour of Death. If it be ſaid, that he can by a particular Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſudden Inſpirations, by a kind of Miracle, Convert a Sinner in his laſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; I will not diſpute what God can do; but I will not ſcruple to ſay, that in the ordinary courſe of Grace, Converſion is not wrought by ſudden and miraculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations: The Goſpel ſpeaks of nothing like that, and thoſe who look for ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, had beſt ſee, what they found their hope upon.</p>
                  <p>It is certain beſides, that Repentance is moſt difficult on Mans part, when he is at the point of Death. If a Man has lived in Ignorance and Vice, is he not in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dying Ignorant and Hardned? How will he perform Duties then, of which he has not ſo much as a Notion? Can a Man at that time change his ill Inclinations and ſhake of his vicious Habits of a ſudden? All thoſe who have applied themſelves to the Work of Converſion, know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that the Conqueſt, I will not ſay of many, but of one ſingle Vice, has required both Time, and aſſiduous and conſtant care. Vicious Habits are not to be deſtroyed but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96537:108"/>by degrees, and good ones are acquired on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reiterated Acts. It is repugnant to Mans Nature, that this ſhould be done in an Inſtant. How can any one then reckon, that ſo conſiderable a Change, as that which true Converſion requires, will be effected in the ſhort time of a Sickneſs? And if this was poſſible, and through great endeavours might be done, yet can any Man aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſhall have then all that Freedom and all that Strength of Mind and Body, which are neceſſary to ſet about this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reformation? Is the time of Sickneſs wherein a Man is ſo much ſunk, and has the leaſt either of Leiſure or Strength, ſo very ſit for a Buſineſs of this Importance? All that a Man can do then, is to betake himſelf to ſome confuſed and abrupt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, the ordinary Refuge of thoſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who have lived in a ſtate of Obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But will that ſerve the turn? Are ſome haſty Reflections upon a Man's paſt Life, ſome Acts of Contrition, ſome Prayers proceeding from trouble and agony and extorted only by the fear of Death, ſome Sobs and Groans indiſtinctly breathed up to Heaven; are theſe, I ſay, ſufficient to make amends for all that is paſt, to extirpate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inveterate Habits, and to ſecure to a Sinner an Eternity of Bliſs?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add Two Conſideration which are Convincing, and cannot be conteſted.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96537:109"/>
                  <p n="1">1. By growing in Years, Men loſe the ſenſe and remembrance of their Sins. Age and Cuſtom produce this Effect. Excepting ſome extraordinary Sins which cannot be forgot, moſt Men do not remember their Faults. And how ſhould they remember them, ſince for the moſt part they do not perceive when they commit them? We daily ſee Men, who will Lye, and Swear, and fly out into Paſſion almoſt every Minute; and yet do not reflect upon it; nay, they think themſelves free from thoſe Faults. This Error proceeds ſo far, that ſome very great Sinners, who are living in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Practices, fancy themſelves Pious, and make no doubt, but that they are in the Favour of God. Now ſince the Cuſtom of Sinning, does blind Men to ſuch a Degree; is it likely that after they have ſpent their Lives in this Security, they will effectually Repent at their Death? Can a Man Repent who does not know the. Reaſons why he ſhould, who docs not feel, or has forgot his Sins, and who thinks beſides, that he is in a good State, and that he needs no Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Repentance ſuppoſes the Knowledge, of Sin it ſuppoſes beſides a Hatred of it. But hew ho has loved Sin to the laſt, is leſs able then to hate, than he is to know his Sins. I cannot comprehend, how a Man who has loved the World all his Life, who has made
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96537:109"/>it his only delight and ſtudy, to gratifie his Luſts, and who has always been cold and indifferent towards Religion; ſhould when Death appears; ſuddenly change his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, hate what he loved, and love what till then he looked upon with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference. So quick a paſſage from the Love, to the Hatred of Sin, is very rare. The ſorrow for Sin, and the Hatred of it, are always faint and weak in the beginnings of Repentance, even in thoſe who repent ſincerely. Converſion proceeds by degrees; a Man muſt have diſcontinued ſinning, and be already ſettled in the Habits of Virtue; before he can have a ſtrong averſion to ſin. And what kind of Repentance then can that be, which begins in the extremity of Life?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But here it is Objected firſt, that God is always ready to reſtore the greateſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his Favour, when they have recourſe to his Mercy, and that there are expreſs Promiſes in the Goſpel, which aſſure us of this. I grant it: God never rejects a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinner. But before a Man can build upon this, the hope of being received into God's Favour at the Hour of Death, he muſt be ſure that he ſhall then ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Now I think I have demonſtrated, that this is what no Man can depend upon. As to the Promiſes which are made to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the Goſpel; I do not deny but
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96537:110"/>that they may be applied in a good ſenſe to all Sinners; but yet it is certain, that they are made in favour of thoſe, whom God was to call to the Chriſtian Religion, and chiefly in favour of the Heathens. Chriſt and his Apoſtles were to aſſure all Men, that the ſins they had commited, ſhould not exclude them from the Covenant of Grace, provided they did ſincerely mourn for them, and part with them. When the Heathens came to Baptiſm, nothing elſe was required of them, but that they ſhould Repent, and make a ſolemn Vow of being Holy for the time to come. But as to Chriſtians it cannot be ſaid, that God demands nothing of them but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Sorrow for Sins; for he calls them to Holineſs upon pain of Damnation.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe it was that the Apoſtles preached Repentance, and by this we may know, how much Chriſtianity is decayed. That Repentance which conſiſts in the Confeſſion of Sins, and in a Reſolution to forſake them, is the Duty at which the Heathens began. This was the firſt thing which the Apoſtles required of them, it was preparatory to the Chriſtian Religion. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. VI.</note> places the Doctrine of Repentance, among the Fundamental Points, and the firſt Duties in which the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were inſtructed before Baptiſm. But now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96537:110"/>look upon Repentance, as the Duty with which they are to end their Lives, that is to ſay; they deſign to end, where the Heathens begun, and to enter Heaven at the ſame Gate, which admitted <hi>Pagans</hi> into the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will be ſaid further, that ſometimes Men, who have lived in Sin; die to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in very good Diſpoſitions. To this I reply; That we ſee a great many more of thoſe Perſons, who die in a ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility; and that by Conſequence, a Sinner who puts off his Repentance, has more reaſon to fear, than to hope. For who has told him, that the Fate of theſe laſt, will not be his; and what ſurer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage can there be, of ſo Tragical a Death, than the preſent hardneſs of his Heart? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I do not know, whether it happens frequently, as the Objection ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that Perſons who have lived ill, are well diſpoſed when they die. If Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can be ſaving and effectual when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins only upon a Death-bed, every body muſt own, that it ought to be very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deep, attended with demonſtrations of the moſt bitter Sorrow, and with all the Proofs that a dying Man can give of the Sincerity of his Converſion. But we do not ſee many Inſtances of this Nature. There are but few great Sinners, who expreſs a lively Compunction at their Death,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96537:111"/>or a ſincere Deteſtation of their Sins, who have a due ſenſe of their Wickedneſs, and endeavour as much as they can to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it, who practiſe Reſtitution, and edify all about them, by diſcharging the other obligations of Conſcience. It is but ſeldom that we ſee ſuch Penitents.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Expreſſions of Devotion and Repentance, which are uſed by dying Men, are not always ſincere. It is much to be feared that their. Repentance is nothing elſe but a certain Emotion, which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Dying, and the approaches of God's Judgment, muſt needs raiſe in the Mind of every Man, who has his Wits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and has ſome Ideas of Religion. Nothing is more deceitful, than the judging of a Man by what he either ſays, or does, when he is under the effects of Fear or Trouble. It is commonly ſaid of thoſe, who have given ſome ſigns of Piety upon their Death-beds, that they have made a very Chriſtian End: But there is often a great Miſtake in that Judgment. And to be ſatisfied of it, we need but obſerve what happens to ſome who have eſcaped Death, or ſome eminent Danger. While the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril laſted, who could be more humble and holy than they? They ſhewed ſo much Devotion; and uttered ſuch Diſcourſes. that all the Standers by were ediſyed by them; their Tears, their Prayers, their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96537:111"/>Proteſtations of Amendment, in a Word, their whole Deportment, had in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo much of Chriſtian Zeal in it, that the Beholders were ſtruck with Admiration. But are there many of theſe, who when the Danger is over, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame Diſpoſitions, remember their Promiſes, or alter any thing in their former Courſe of Life? Almoſt all of them return to their old Habits as ſoon as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity is paſt. Theſe are generally the fruits of that Repentance which is excited by the fear of Death, in thoſe who Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; And what Effects then can it have in reſpect of thoſe that Dye?</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, we ought not to condemn any Body; but I think we ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a definitive Sentence, in favour of thoſe who have led an ill Life. For tho' Mens Judgment makes no alteration in the State of the Dead; yet it may have a very pernicious Effect upon the Living, who conclude from it, that a Man may die well, tho' he has lived ill. And while I am upon this Subject, I muſt ſay, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes more to the keeping up of theſe dangerous Opinions, than when the Miniſters of Religion commend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcretion, the Piety of the Dead. And yet this is frequently done, eſpecially in great Towns, and in the Courts of Princes. There are to be found in thoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96537:112"/>Places, mean-ſpirited and unworthy Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who proſtitute their Tongues and their Pens to the Praiſe of ſome Perſons, who had nothing of Chriſtianity in their Lives, and whoſe Condition ſhould rather make a Man tremble. But if ſome remnant of Shame reſtrains them from carrying their Flattery ſo far, as to commend the Lives of thoſe, whoſe Panegyrick they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; then they ſeek the Matter of their Praiſes, in ſome ſigns of Piety, which thoſe Perſons gave, before they left the World Now I dare ſay, that the moſt Atheiſtical Diſcourſes, and the Corrupteſt Maxims of Libertines, are not by much ſo ſubtil a Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſuch kind of Elogies, delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men who are engaged in all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Age, and then diſperſed through the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Inſtance of the Converted Thief, who prayed to our Saviour upon the Croſs, and was received into Paradice, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom forgotten. But this Inſtance is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very ill underſtood. Firſt, it is ſuppoſed, without any ground for it; that this Thief repented only upon the Croſs, and that his Converſion was the effect of a ſudden Inſpiration. But who can tell whether his Converſion was not begun, either before he was taken, or in the Priſon, where it is probable that he was kept for ſome time, before the Feaſt of Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96537:112"/>over? But if his Converſion, muſt needs be ſudden, and wrought only a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before his Death; if we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity aſcribe it to a Miraculous Inſpiration and to thoſe ſingular Circumſtances, which he then happen'd to be in; yet I do not ſee what can be inferr'd from this Inſtance; ſince no Man living can aſſure himſelf that any ſuch thing will befall him.</p>
                  <p>But be that as it will, we ſhould, I think, obſerve a vaſt difference between the ſtate of this Thief, and that of a Chriſtian This poor Wretch had not been called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Chriſtians are; he had never known our Saviour; or at leaſt he had not profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Religion; he had not had that Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umination and thoſe Opportunities, which Grace offers every day, to thoſe to whom the Goſpel is Preached. And ſo his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance tho' it came late, yet it might be as effectual to Salvation, as that of the Heathens, who embraced Chriſtianity in their riper Years, and who happen'd to die immediately after Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay a word or two upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Labourers, where we read<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. XX.</note>, that thoſe who went to work in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard only an hour before Sun-ſet, received the ſame Wages, with thoſe who had been at work ever ſince the Morning. From this Sinners imagine it may be proved by an
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96537:113"/>invincible Argument, that thoſe who Repent but a little before Death, will obtain the ſame Reward with thoſe whole Life has been Regular. But this is not our Saviour's meaning in that Parable. It ſignifies only, that thoſe whom God ſhould call laſt, and who ſhould anſwer his Call, were to be received into the Covenant, in the ſame manner as thoſe, who had been called to it before, and that the Heathens ſhould ſhare in the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges with the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> had been in Covenant with God, a great while before the Heathens. This our Saviour declares in theſe Words, which conclude the Parable; <hi>ſo the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt.</hi> Here is nothing that can be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe Chriſtians, who delay their Converſion. They are not in the ſame Caſe with the Labourers, who were ſent but late into the Vineyard. Thoſe Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers went no ſooner, <hi>becauſe no Man had hired them;</hi> but they went as ſoon as they were ſent. I ſay, Chriſtians are not in this Caſe, ſince they have been called in the Morning, and at all the Hours of the Day, being Born and having always lived in the Church.</p>
                  <p>I have been ſomewhat large in ſhewing how unreaſonable and dangerous the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of thoſe Men is, who pretend to Repent only at the end of their Lives. But
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96537:113"/>all thoſe who put off their Converſion, do not put it off ſo far. There are many who acknowledge, that it is dangerous to ſtay till the extremity, and that it is neceſſary to Repent betimes; they propoſe to go about it in a little time, and they hope that they ſhall Repent ſoon enough, not to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Death under a total hardning; but in the mean while they do nothing toward their Converſion.</p>
                  <p>This way of Delaying, is an Illuſion, which does not appear ſo groſs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as the former, becauſe it ſuppoſes ſome Inclination to Good. But yet it is no better than an Artifice of the Heart, a Trick of Self-love, by which a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and blinds himſelf. Nay, in ſome reſpects, the State of theſe laſt, is more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and dangerous, than that of the firſt. It is more criminal, becauſe they do not what they approve of, and becauſe they ſin againſt the conſtant Admonitions of their Conſciences, and do not perform their Reſolutions and their Promiſes. But it is likewiſe more dangerous; for with this Intention to Repent in a little time, they think themſelves much better than thoſe who are reſolved to Repent only upon their Death-bed; they, applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſuch a ſenſe of Piety as they have; and they judge, that if they are not quite in a ſtate of Salvation; at leaſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96537:114"/>they are not far from it. Now one may eaſily ſee that ſuch an Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can only lay their Conſciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and inſpire them with Preſumption and Security.</p>
                  <p>But all things conſidered, they go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe good Diſpoſitions, than thoſe, who without ſhuffling, refer the whole matter to the end of their Lives. All the difference is, that the latter do all at once, what the others do ſucceſſively. And therefore all that has been ſaid in this Chapter, may almoſt wholly be applied to theſe laſt. They run the ſame Risk with thoſe who deſign to Repent only upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, ſince Death may ſurprize them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have executed their good Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. They have as little love for God, and are as much addicted to their Luſts: That which deceives them, is, that they fancy, that there is in them a ſincere Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Converſion. But if this Intention is ſincere, how comes it to paſs that they do not Repent? When a Man is reſolved upon a thing, when his Heart is in it, when he deſires it in good earneſt, he goes about it without loſing time.</p>
                  <p>But when a Man uſes Delays, it is a ſign that he is not well reſolved yet: A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which no Effect follows, is not a fixed and ſettled Reſolution. This purpoſe of Converſion, is therefore but one of thoſe wavering Deſigns and Projects, which are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96537:114"/>formed every Day, but never accompliſhed. It is no more than a general and unactive Intention, which may perhaps be found in all Men. But other ſorts of purpoſes are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Man who hopes to be ſaved. Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not obtained by bare Deſigns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but by the actual Practice of Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now Men might eaſily be undeceived, and Convince themſelves of the un-ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all thoſe Reſolutions they make in relation to Repentance; if they did but reflect upon the time paſt, and ask themſelves whether they have not been very near in the ſame Sentiments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, for ſome years together? And yet theſe Sentiments have produced nothing, and thoſe Reſolutions have made no Change in them; they are ſtill in the ſame ſtate, and perhaps farther from Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than ever. Muſt not Men blindfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they do not ſee, that it will ſtill be the ſame thing for the future, and that Life will ſlip away in perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays? For what can they promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the time to come, and what ground have they to hope that it will not be like the time paſt? Are they more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved than they were before? When will this Reſolution be put in Practice? Will it be in a Month, or in a Year? They muſt confeſs they do not know when it will be. So that when they promiſe to repent, they do not know what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96537:115"/>nay, they cannot tell whether they promiſe any thing. They will ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that they hope to confirm themſelves in a good Purpoſe; but what do they found this Hope upon? What do they wait for, and what new thing do the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine will happen to them? Have they any aſſurance that God will uſe for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, other Means and Motives than thoſe, which he has uſed already? Nay, how do they know but that they ſhall be deprived of thoſe Means and Helps which hitherto have been tender'd them? How can they tell whether there is a time to come for them, and whether their Life is not juſt ready to end? All this is very uncertain. But what is certainly true is this, that through ſo many Procraſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their Hearts grow harder, and their return to Vertue becomes more difficult. The Love of Sin increaſes by the Habit of ſinning, and the Means appointed to work Repentance, loſe ſomething of their force every day.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations do evidently ſhew, that the deferring of Converſion, is an Error as groſs, as it is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>I think it will not be uſeleſs, to conclude this Chapter, with obſerving that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſo many put off their Converſion, is, becauſe they look upon Repentance as an auſtere and melancholy Duty. And this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96537:115"/>Notion muſt needs put them upon defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Practice of it. It is therefore of the greateſt moment, to deſtroy that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; and to ſhew on the contrary, that if there is any ſad and deplorable Condition, it is that of a Man who lives in Sin. For that is either a State of Fear and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, or of Security and Inſenſibility Such a Man can have no ſolid Peace of Conſcience during his Life, and what Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt he fall into, when the thoughts of Death and of a Judgment to come happens to make ſome lively Impreſſion upon his Mind? For granting that then he may uſe ſome endeavours to diſpoſe himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; yet beſides the danger of a late Repentance, it is a ſad thing to end one's Life in thoſe Struggles and Terrors, which muſt needs accompany ſuch a Repentance. A Man who delays his Converſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs his Miſery, and makes it greater and more incurable. But Joy and Tranquility are the portion of a pure Conſcience. There is no Felicity or Contentment, like that of a Soul which is freed from the bondage of Sin. Repentance is the beginning of that Happineſs, which grows ſweeter and more perfect, according to the progreſs we make in Virtue. Then it is that a Man is happy in all the Circumſtances of Life, beſides that he has the Comfort of being ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the approaches of Death, with that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96537:116"/>Peace and Joy, which flow from a well grounded Confidence in the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Teſtimony of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and from a ſteady hope of Immortality.</p>

               <div n="7" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE VII. Mens Sloth and Negligence in Matters of Religion.</head>
                  <p>IT is natural and ordinary to Men, to be unconcerned about thoſe things, which they do not know, or of which they do not apprehend the Uſe and Neceſſity. And ſo we may eaſily conceive that Men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Ignorance, and being poſſeſſed with thoſe Notions I have now Confuted, muſt needs be very negligent and ſlothful, in what relates to Religion. But as this Sloth conſidered in it ſelf, is a viſible Cauſe of Corruption, ſo it will be fitting to take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of it in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe, in the firſt place, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Man to attain the End which Religion propoſes to him, without uſing the proper Means which lead to that End. In religious as well as in worldly Concerns, nothing is to be had without Labour and Care. As there are Means appointed for preſerving the Life of the Body, ſo there are ſome ordained for maintaining
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96537:116"/>the Life of the Soul; and th laſt means, is of the two the more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe there is more care and forecaſt requiſite in order to Salvation, about preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Life of die Soul, than for ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of the Body. It is certain that the more excellent any thing is, the more it requires our Care; but beſides that we ſee the Life of the Body is eaſily preſerved; a Natural Inclination prompts us to thoſe things which are neceſſary for our Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the means of ſupplying our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Wants, offer themſelves to us, as it were of their own accord. But it is not ſo with the ſpiritual Life. Conſidering our proneneſs to Evil, and the preſent State we are in, we cannot avoid being undone, if we neglect the neceſſary Care of our Souls, and if we follow all the Bents and Propenſions of our Nature. Religion obliges us upon many occaſions, to reſiſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and to offer violence to our ſelves, it requires Self-denial, Watchfulneſs and Labour; it lays many Duties upon us and it preſcribes divers Means, without the uſe of which, we cannot but continue ſtill in Corruption and Death: I ſhall then but juſt name the Chiefeſt of thoſe Duties and Means.</p>
                  <p>Before all things, a Chriſtian ought to be Inſtructed, he ought to know with ſome exactneſs, both the Truths, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtianity: Now this Knowledge
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96537:117"/>cannot be acquired, without Hearing, Reading, Meditation, or ſome other Care of this Nature. In the next place, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does not conſiſt in bare Knowledge, but chiefly in Practice; none of thoſe Means ſhould be neglected, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to divert Men from Vice, and to ſpur them on Vertue. Theſe Means are very many, but they are all comprehended under theſe two principal Heads; The Exerciſes of Devotion, and the Circumſpections which every Perſon ought to uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Exerciſes of Devotion are mighty Helps to Piety and Salvation; I mean ſuch as Meditation, Reading, and Particularly Prayer, which is one of the moſt eſſential Acts of Religion, as well as one of the moſt efficacious Means to advance Holineſs. There are on the other hand ſeveral methods of Circumſpection and Care, which are of abſolute Neceſſity: As for inſtance; the foreſeeing &amp; ſhunning the occaſions which may draw us into ſin; the ſeeking thoſe Opportunities and Aids which promote Piety, the not being over-much concerned about the Body, the cheriſhing good Thoughts, and the reſiſting evil ones: But above all, it is a thing of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that every one ſhould endeavour thoroughly to know himſelf, which he cannot do, but by examining his preſent ſtate, and by reflecting ſeriouſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon his Actions and Words, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96537:117"/>upon the Thoughts and Motions of his Heart. All theſe Cares are eſſential and neceſſary. For without the uſe of thoſe Means, it is as impoſſible to be religious and pious, as it would be to live and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with out Nouriſhment. A Man who will neither eat nor drink, muſt needs die in a little time, And ſo the Spiritual Life will ſoon be extinct, if the only means which can ſupport it, are not uſed.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee now whether, theſe Cares and Means which I have ſhewn to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, are made uſe of. It is ſo viſible that they are almoſt totally neglected, that I need not be very large upon the Proof of it.</p>
                  <p>Men take little care of being inſtructed, and of getting Information and Knowledge about Religion. The far greater Part ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot read, or never apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any uſeful inſtructive Reading. Few hearken to the Inſtructions that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, and fewer yet examine or reflect upon them. Carnal Luſts and Secular Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do ſo engroſs them, that they ſeldom or never give themſelves to ſearching the Truth. They generally have an Averſion to ſpiritual Things. Hence it is that in matters of Religion; they will rather believe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely what is told them, than be at the pains of enquiring, whether it is true or not. And they are every whit as careleſs
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96537:118"/>about Exerciſes of Devotion. Many would think it a Puniſhment if they were made to read or to Meditate. They never do thoſe things, but with reluctancy and as ſeldom as they can. They go about Prayer eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, with a ſtrange Indifference, and a criminal Indevotion. In ſhort, very few take the neceſſary care to preſerve themſelves from Vice, and to behave themſelves with Regularity and Caution; Very few ſeek the Opportunities of doing good, and avoid the Temptations, to which the common Condition of Men, or their own particular Circumſtances expoſe them; And the greateſt Numbers are ſlaves to their Bodies, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with earthly things. One of the moſt ſenſible and fatal effects of this Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, is that thoſe Perſons uſe no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of endeavours to know themſelves. It is very ſeldom if ever, that they reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what paſſes within them; upon their Thoughts, their Inclinations, the Motions of their Hearts, and the Principles they Act upon; or that they take a review of their Words and Actions. They do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether they have within them the Characters, of good Men or of wicked and hypocritical Perſons. In a word almoſt all of them live without Reflection.</p>
                  <p>Mens careleſneſs about Religion is there fore extreamly great. But they proceed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in the things of the World, about
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96537:118"/>which they are as Active and Laborious as they are Lazy and cold in reference to true Piety. They will do every thing for their Bodies, and nothing for their Souls. They ſpare no Induſtry or Diligence, they omit nothing to promote their Temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. If we were to judge by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, we would think that the Supreme Good is to be found, in Earthly Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that Salvation is the leaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of all things.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſay what Effects ſuch a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence muſt produce. The greater part of Chriſtians, being Ignorant in their Duty, having no Knowledge of themſelves, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the uſe of thoſe Means which God has appointed, and without which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that no Man can be ſaved; and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out their Lives in this Ignorance and Sloth, it is not to be imagined, that they can have any Religion or Piety; and ſo there muſt be a general Corruption amongſt them. I ſay it muſt be ſo, unleſs God ſhould work Miracles, or rather change the Nature of Man, and invert the Order and the Laws which he has eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it might be ſaid that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not live like Atheiſts, and that their Negligence is not ſo great as I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it; Let us conſider a little, what ſort of Care they beſtow, upon the concerns of their Souls. Certainly there are ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96537:119"/>who are not guilty of this Negligence: But excepting theſe; what is it which the reſt of Mankind do, in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Very little or Nothing. They pray, they aſſiſt ſometimes at Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and at the publick Exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they hear Sermons, they receive the Sacrament, and they perform ſome other Duties of this Nature. This is all which the Religion of the greateſt part amounts to. But firſt, theſe are not only the Duties which ought to be practis'd; there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are not leſs eſſential, and which yet are generally neglected; ſuch as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Reading, Self-examination; to ſay nothing here of the Duties of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. So that if ſome Acts of Religion are performed, others are quite omitted. The reaſon of this Proceeding may eaſily be diſcovered. There is a Law and a Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which oblige all Perſons to ſome Acts of Religion; to pray, to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to go now and then to Church: If a Man ſhould intirely neglect theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Duties he would be thought an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt: But there is neither Cuſtom, nor Law, nor Worldly Decency, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a Man to Meditate, to examine his own Conſcience, or to watch over his Conduct, and therefore theſe Duties being left to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones Direction are very little obſerved.</p>
                  <p>As to the other Duties which Chriſtians
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96537:119"/>form in ſome meaſure, the want of ſincerity in them, does moſt commonly turn them into ſo many Acts of Hypocriſy. They perhaps ſay ſome Prayers in the Morning; but this is done without Devotion, haſtily, with diſtraction, and wearineſs, and only to get rid of it; after they think no more of God, all the Day, but are altogether buſied about the World and their Paſſions; and in the Evening they Pray with greater wandring of Thoughts than in the Morning. If it ſo fall out, that they go to Church, or hear a Sermon, they do not give a quarter of an Hours cloſe Attention, to any thing that is ſaid, or done in the Publick Aſſemblies. In many Places the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the People, conſiſts in being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at ſome Sermons, which are as little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſructive, as they are minded or hearkned to. The uſe which is made of the Sacraments, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the Euchariſt, converts them into vain Ceremonies, and makes them rather Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, than Helps to Salvation. As to the mortifying of the Body by reaſonable Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, Faſting and Retirement, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Duty. The Indifference of Chriſtians is therefore but too palpable. What they do upon the account of Religion is very little; and yet they do that little ſo ill, that it is not much more beneficial to them, than if they did nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>And now what might not be ſaid, if after having thus ſhewn, that what Men do for
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96537:120"/>their Salvation is next to nothing; I ſhould undertake to prove, that they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing that is neceſſary for their Damnation; and that they are as zealous and induſtrious for their Ruin, as they are ſlothful and negligent in what is requiſite to preſerve them. There are means to Corrupt as well as to Sanctify our ſelves. The means of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Perdition, are, Ignorance, want of Attention, neglect of Devotion, the love of the World, and of the Fleſh, unruly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Temptations, and ill Examples. Now ſuppoſing, that a Man was ſo monſtrouſly Frantick, as to form the deſign of Damning himſelf; what would ſuch a Man do? He would neglect the Exerciſes of Devotion, he would not Pray at all, or he would Pray only with his Lips, he would profane the Sacraments by an unſanctifyed uſe of them, he would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind his Body and this preſent Life, he would give looſe Reins to his Paſſions, as much as he might with Decency and without danger; if he had an opportunity to gratify his Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, his Covetouſneſs, his Pride, or any other wicked Affection, he would gladly embrace it. This is what a Man would do to Damn himſelf: And is it not what a great many actually do? I confeſs, no Man is capable of ſo wild a Reſolution, as to deſign to Damn himſelf; but a Man ſufficiently Damns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he takes no care of his Salvation, and when he does thoſe things, which will infallibly bring his Perdition after them.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:96537:120"/>
                  <p>The Sloth and Negligence of Men in the Concerns of their Souls, being one of the Cauſes of their Corruption, it would be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to remedy that Negligence, and to inſpire them with Zeal for Religion; but it is hard to ſucceed in this. Lazineſs is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a certain ſweetneſs to which Men give up themſelves with Pleaſure. The ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful do love and delight in Reſt; they cannot endure to be egged on to Labour. This is one of thoſe Habits which are moſt difficult to be conquered; and to ſay the Truth, there is but little hope of thoſe, in whom it is grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate: It is a great Task to rouze them out of that ſlulggiſh and lethargick Temper. God muſt interpoſe by a particular Grace, by great Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or by ſome other extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                  <p>But yet, I do not think it altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to overcome this ſinful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sloth, or to preſerve thoſe from it, whom it has not ſeized as yet. Serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the importance of Salvation, and upon the Neceſſity of working at it, may produce that Effect. Men would not live in this Careleſneſs, but that either they do not apprehend of what Conſequence it is to be Saved, or that they imagine, there is not much to be done for the obtaining of Salvation. Theſe two Prejudices maintain their Lazineſs, Nothing can therefore be more uſeful, than to convince them on the one hand, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96537:121"/>in the World is of greater Moment than Religion, and that Eternal Happineſs is the higheſt of all Concernments: And to let them ſee on the other hand, that this Felicity is not to be attained, but by aſſiduous Care, and an exact obſervation of the Duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p>I know it is difficult to make Men ſeriouſly enter upon theſe Reflections; but yet they ought ſtill to be laid before them, and we ſhould not give over. If they have no Effect at one time, there are Circumſtances in which they will prove ſucceſsful. I think, few would continue in this ſluggiſh Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they did repreſent to themſelves what Notions and Thoughts they ſhall have at the end of their Lives. Every Man is ſatisfied that he muſt die one Day, and that his Condition will then be the Happieſt that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, if he has made uſe of the Time and Opportunities he had to ſecure his Salvation; but that if he has neglected theſe Means, he ſhall find himſelf in ſtrange Agonies, and be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſmal Extremities. When Death appears, when the World vaniſhes, a Man is then wholly taken up with Religion, he would give then all the World, if it was in his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, to ſecure to himſelf a better Life. Now ſince we all know that this muſt one Day be our Caſe, Wiſdom requires, that we ſhould overcome betimes that Negligence, of which the Conſequences will be ſo fatal; and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96537:121"/>that we ſhould apply our ſelves with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure to that Work, upon which our ſovereign Felicity depends.</p>

               <div n="8" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE VIII. Worldly Buſineſs.</head>
                  <p>NEgligence commonly proceeds, either from Indifference, or from Diſtraction. We neglect thoſe things, which we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with indifference, but we frequently alſo neglect things of Moment, becauſe we are diſtracted by other Cares. Theſe are the two Cauſes of Mens Careleſneſs in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. On the one hand, Piety is Indifferent to them, they neither know the Nature nor the Excellency of it; the Duties which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, do not appear very pleaſant or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to them; they love and eſteem only the things of the World; all this I have Proved, in the foregoing Chapters. On the other hand, they are diſtracted by Temporal Cares, which rob them of the leiſure and freedom, that are neceſſary for the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Practice of Religion. Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore is another Source of Corruption, as I hope to prove it by the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p>I reckon among Worldly Employments, all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96537:122"/>thoſe Cares which relate to the World, or this preſent Life, whether they take up the Body or the Mind. There are Temporal Cares which properly take up the Body; ſuch are the Cares of Mechanicks, or Husband-men; and there are other S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ular Cares, which chiefly employ the Mind, ſuch is the Study of Humane Learning, of Politicks, or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Theſe laſt as well as the firſt, ought to be counted Worldly Buſineſs. Nay, we may obſerve that difference between theſe two ſorts of Temporal Employments; that the Cares which take up the Mind are ſometimes the more dangerous. While the Body is at Work the Mind may be at liberty; but when the Mind is Employed, when the Heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and poſſeſſed with Temporal Cares, it is much harder for the Thoughts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to enter, or to make any Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man.</p>
                  <p>But whether theſe Employments relate to the Mind or to the Body, we ought not to think that they are of themſelves hindrances to Piety. For this Imagination, would be a very groſs Error. Worldly Buſineſs is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Neceſſary, and it were a Sin to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, ſince that would be contrary to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God has eſtabliſhed in the World. Nay it may be uſeful to our Salvation, it may divert ill Thoughts, it may take off Men from trifling and vicious Employments, and it may ſerve to mortify the Body, and to baniſh
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96537:122"/>Idleneſs which is the Spring of all manner of Vice.</p>
                  <p>I make this Remark becauſe ſome People fancy, that in Order to be ſaved, it muſt be neceſſary to live in an abſolute Retirement, to lay aſide all Temporal Cares, and to give up our ſelves wholly to ſpiritual Exerciſes, to Reading, Contemplation, Meditation, and Prayer. But thoſe who do thus ſtretch the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of renouncing the World, and inſiſt ſo much upon a Retired and Contemplative Life, do not I doubt, very well underſtand the nature of Piety, nor do any great Service to it. Sometimes by endeavouring-to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize Men too much, we ſpoil all, and we make Piety appear ridiculous or impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We ſhould always remember that Piety is made for Man. Now it is not One in Fifty that can thus embrace Retirement, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely renounce the World. I am far from condemning Retirement; it is ſometimes very ſeaſonable, and I think it in ſome ſenſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Men, There are ſome Perſons who for the ſake of their Salvation, or the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, ought to chuſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Life, diſingaged from Temporal Cares. Others are called to that kind of Life by the Circumſtances which Providence has placed them in. And beſides, there is no Chriſtian, but ought to allow himſelf ſome times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; nay, there are ſome Temporal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments which do not hinder a Man to live
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96537:123"/>in a Retired manner. But after all, it would be the Ruin of Society, and of moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vertues, if every one ſhould live a-part, and buſy himſelf only in Spiritual Exerciſes. God does not require this; he has Created Man to labour in the World, and thoſe who follow an honeſt Employment in it, act ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his Will, and ſink their Buſineſs may prove a Help to their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I need not I think advertiſe the Reader; that I ſpeak here only of lawful Employments, and not of thoſe which are bad and contrary to the Laws of Nature or Religion. And yet theſe laſt are very common; but becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body may eaſily ſee that ſuch Occupations muſt unavoidably engage Men in to ſin, I will make it my chief buſineſs to ſhew, that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and innocent Employments, prove to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons, a hind'rance to Piety and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Temporal Employments then being not bad in themſelves, they cannot occaſion Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but by the Abuſe that is made of them. Now there are four Faults which Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is when they are intirely taken up with Worldly Things. We have ſhewed already, that Men live in a prodigious Sloth and Careleſneſs about Religion, and that they do almoſt nothing for their Souls and their Salvation. From this it follows, that they muſt be employed only about their Bodies
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96537:123"/>and the Concerns of this Life, And in fact, if we inquire into their Cares, we ſhall find that they terminate in the World, and in their Temporal Intereſt; and this I think needs not be proved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Hearts ſink too deep into the things of the World. The Buſineſs of Life is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent when it is followed with Moderation; but it diverts Men from Piety, when it is purſued more, and with greater eagerneſs than it deſerves. That exceſſive love of the World, makes the unhappineſs of Men. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of eſteeming Temporal Goods in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Worth, and as remembring that they are not able to procure them true Felicity; inſ of conſidering that they are not made for this life only, and that they cannot long enjoy thoſe advantages which they court; they give up themſelves wholly to the World, they ſet their Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon it, and they act as if this life was the ultimate end of all their Actions. They labour only for their Bodies, and for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of their Appetites. This is the Mark aimed at in all their Thoughts and Projects: This is what inflames their Deſires, and what excites in them the moſt violent Paſſions of Grief or Joy, of Anxiety or Impatience. They are far from having ſuch a hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Religion and Piety. In relation to this, their Affections are faint and languid, and they do nothing but with Indifference, or by conſtraint.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:96537:124"/>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third Fault is when Men are too much employ'd, and when they overload themſelves with Buſineſs. It is a great piece of Wiſdom, both in reſpect of the Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Life, and the concerns of another; to avoid the exceſs and the hurry of Buſineſs, as much as poſſibly we may, without being wanting to the Duties of our Calling; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our ſelves to neceſſary Cares, and to wave all ſuperfluous ones. Men would live happy if they did but know, what their Profeſſion requires of them, and limit themſelves to it, without medling in that which does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them. But here they obſerve no bounds. They will fly at all, they will buſie themſelves about many things, which do not belong to their Province. This without doubt is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſeaſe, and the occaſion of ſeveral Diſorders.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the laſt place, there is one thing more to blame, and that is when worldly Buſineſs, becomes an occaſion of Sin, by the abuſe that is made of it. For beſides that it is a very ill Diſpoſition in a Chriſtian to be fond of the World; moſt Men are ſo unhappy as to direct all the buſineſs of Life to a bad end, which is to ſatisfy and to enflame the more their irregular Appetites. And by this means, many Enterprizes and particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theirs, which in themſelves are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, become evil and unlawful, and engage them in all manner of Sins.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:96537:124"/>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations is prove already, that the greateſt part of Mens Vices proceeds from their Temporal Affairs; but this will appear yet more clearly by the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This exceſſive Application to Temporal Concerns, engroſſes almoſt our whole Time, ſo that it does not leave us a ſufficient ſhare of it, to be ſpent in cares of another nature. Men confeſs this themſelves, and plead it for an Excuſe. They alledge their Buſineſs. A Man who is engaged in the World will ſay; <hi>I have no time to read, or to perform the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion; I have too much Buſineſs, my Employ or my Calling does not leave me a minute of leiſure.</hi> And the Truth is, they are too buſie for the moſt part. If they have any ſpare time, ſome hours or ſome days of reſt, wherein the courſe of their ordinary Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is interrupted; they are not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to improve to the beſt Advantage thoſe ſhort Intervals of Relaxation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And truly, Secular Buſineſs doeſ not only take away the beſt part of Mens Time, but it does beſides diſtract their Minds and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their Hearts and Affections. When for a whole Day or Week the Mind and Body have been in agitation, a Man is weary and ſpent, the activity of his Thoughts is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, his Head is too full to be clear, he is not able to drive away in an inſtant ſo many Worldly Idea's, to calm his Paſſions, and to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96537:125"/>turn himſelf of the ſudden, to Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. So that he muſt either abſolutely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Duties of Piety, or perform them very ill When a Man has brought himſelf to a Habit, of being employed only in Worldly Affairs, he is no longer Maſter of his own Thoughts and Motions. It is with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, if he can at all apply himſelf to Objects that are foreign to him. Thoſe Objects affect him but weakly; he muſt make great Efforts, before he can faſten upon them; and if he fixes there for a few moments, it is a violent ſtate in which he cannot continue long. Thoſe Thoughts, of which he is conſtantly full, crowd in upon him, and he returns immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to theſe Things which he loves, and which commonly take him up.</p>
                  <p>This is the true reaſon, why Men love andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Spiritual Things ſo little, and why they think it ſo hard to ſubdue their Minds with Reading, Attention, and Meditation. This is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the main Source of Indevotion in the Exerciſes of Piety. Why is the Mind ſo apt to wander in Prayer? The too great Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Temporal Affairs is the Cauſe of it. As ſoon as a Man is awake in the Morning, a throng of Thoughts and a Multiplicity of Deſigns and Buſineſs break in upon his Mind, and take poſſeſſion of his Heart; he is filled with theſe Things all the day, he follows and plods upon them without Diſtraction or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraction. And how is it to be imagined
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96537:125"/>that admidſt all this hurry and turmoil, he ſhould find that Recollection, that Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that Elevation, without which the Exerciſes of Piety are but mere Hypocriſy? Whence comes it to paſs that Men bring ſo little Attention and Sincerity with them, to the publick Worſhip of God? Why do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons produce ſo little fruit? Why do the moſt certain and important Truths of Religion, the cleareſt and the moſt ſolid Reaſonings, make either no Impreſſion at all, or at leaſt no laſting one upon the Hearers? What is the reaſon why in the moſt ſolemn Devotions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Holy Communion, it is ſo difficult for Men to lift up their Hearts to God, and to ſhake off a thouſand idle or ſinful Thoughts, which come then to amuſe and diſtract them? And laſtly, why do thoſe Vows and Promiſes which are made even with ſome ſincerity, prove ſo ineffectual? why do the beſt Reſolutions vaniſh ſo eaſily and ſo ſoon? All this comes from Mens being too much taken up with Temporal Cares.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe exceſſive Cares do not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Mind, but they do beſides directly obſtruct Sanctification, and lead Men into Sin. For firſt it is impoſſible to love Religion and Vertue, when the Heart is ſet upon the World. Our Saviour tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. VI. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>that no man can ſerve two maſters;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> declares,<note n="†" place="bottom">John II. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Love of God is not in thoſe who love the world.</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:96537:126"/>There is ſuch an Oppoſition between Bodily and Spiritual Exerciſes, that thoſe who give themſelves up to the firſt, are incapable of the others. Worldly Occupations render Men Carnal, Senſual and Dull; they keep up Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and foment Sloth, and they weigh down all their Inclinations and Thoughts, to the Earth, ſo that they muſt be Careleſs and Indifferent, about Spiritual Objects and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Concerns.</hi> And indeed they are very ill diſpoſed to value thoſe Good thnigs as they deſerve; or to ſeek them with that Eagerneſs and Sincerity which they ought. Can we think that Men, who propoſe nothing elſe to themſelves, but the amaſſing of Wealth, the making their Court, or the Canvaſſing for Places; and who live and toil only for ſuch things, ſhould have a due ſenſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of their Salvation? It is hard to imagine it.</p>
                  <p>But further, Religion does not allow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to love the World, or to cleave to it.<note n="|" place="bottom">1 Cor. VII.</note> It requires that <hi>they ſhould poſſeſs Temporal Goods as not poſſeſſing them,</hi> and that, <hi>they ſhould uſe the World, as not abuſing it;</hi> becauſe on the one hand, <hi>the Figure of the World paſſes away,</hi> and it would be a Folly to fix their Hearts upon vain and tranſitory Enjoyments: And on the other hand, they ought to aſpire chiefly to the poſſeſſion of ſolid and eternal happineſs. To be therefore taken up only with earthly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96537:126"/>Things, and to let them enter too deep into ones Heart, is a Diſpoſition quite contrary to that, which a Chriſtian ought to be in.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, An exceſſive Application to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs hurries a Man into many Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. We need but reflect a little, to be ſatisfied that a Man who is filled only, with the Thoughts and Solicitudes of this Life, muſt be a Slave to his Senſes and Paſſions; and that he lays himſelf open every Moment to a Thouſand Temptations, which he is not able to withſtand. Tho' his Employments are lawful in themſelves, yet he makes them Criminal, becauſe to him they are only Means of gratifying his Appetites. And the greateſt Miſchief, is that when a Man is once entred upon that Courſe, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms himſelf in it, ſo that at laſt he cannot leave it off. On the one hand, his Paſſions are ſtill mounting higher, on the other, Buſineſs and Toil grow upon him. He firſt propoſos an End to himſelf, and then he will bring it about at any rate, as being engaged in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and by Intereſt not do deſiſt. If he meets with Obſtacles he will do any thing to ſurmount them. If he ſucceeds, Succeſs ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates him with new Ardour; he is for going further: In a word, it is an endleſs labour, a continual ſucceſſion of Cares, which are ſtill growing greater, and which end only with his Life.</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:96537:127"/>
                  <p>From all this we may conclude, that the abuſe of worldly Buſineſs is moſt dangerous, and that if we would not have it obſtruct our Salvation, we ought to obſerve theſe three Rules.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, that we ſhould purſue the Things of this World with Moderation. One of the moſt uſeful Directions for a happy Life, is this; to lay nothing too much to Heart. The way to preſerve our Innocence and Tranquility, is to crave nothing too eagerly; not to rejoyce exceſſively at any Proſperity, not to be dejected above meaſure for any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters which may happen, and not to be too hot and peremptory upon any Deſign. The Second Caution to be uſed, is the avoiding Multiplicity of Buſineſs, and Exceſs of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as much as is conſiſtent with the Duties of our Calling. Every one ſhould conſider what he is fit for, and what he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, and go no farther. In the Laſt Place, Wiſdom requires, that among all the Affairs of this Life we ſhould reſerve the neceſſary Time and Care; to pay what we owe to God and to mind our Salvation, the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of all Concerns. To this end, it is very uſeful, to have certain Times of Retirement and Leiſure, and to accuſtom our ſelves to make now and then even in the midſt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Employments, ſuch Reflections as may call us back to our Duty, and be like a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe to that Byaſs which carries us toward
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96537:127"/>ſenſible Objects. Let us often think that we are mortal, that we have a Soul, and that there is another Life after this. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what all our worldly Cares terminate in, and what Judgment we ſhall make of them upon our Death-Beds. Theſe Reflections will put us upon wiſe and moderate Courſes, and ſo we ſhall avoid innumerable Diſorders and Miſeries which Men fall into, by their too great application to Temporal Buſineſs.</p>

               <div n="9" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE IX. Mens Particular Callings.</head>
                  <p>THo' we have ſeen already that Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has its Source in the Abuſe of Worldly Buſineſs, yet it may be proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a little more upon this Matter, and to Conſider it with relation to the different States and Callings, which Men are ingaged in. When we ſpeak of Worldly Buſineſs, we mean chiefly thoſe things, about which the greateſt part of Life is ſpent. Now thoſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations muſt needs be ſuitable to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kind of Life which a Man follows. And ſo every Man's kind of Life, may be a Source, or at leaſt an accidental Cauſe of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>As the World is Conſtituted, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be different Profeſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96537:128"/>Men, that ſome ſhould Cultivate the Earth, that others ſhould apply themſelves to Arts and Trades, and that others ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Magiſtracy or Traffick. The difference of Sex, Age, Condition, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, creates a great variety in relation to particular Callings. Now this diverſity of Employs and Conditions, is innocent in it ſelf; the World ſubſiſts, and Society is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by it. But yet it cannot be denied, but that a great part of the Diſorders, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the World, proceeds from the kind of Life which Men chuſe, and from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar State they are in; and that becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it, and do not demean themſelves in it, with Caution and Prudence. The Proof of this ſhall conclude the Firſt Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                  <p>But here we are to uſe ſome diſtinction. There are Callings which are bad in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others which are Lawful and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; they are not all therefore equally dangerous, and ſome produce Corruption, more neceſſarily than others.</p>
                  <p>All Profeſſions, or Callings are not Lawful, ſome are Unlawful and Criminal. The World is full of People, who make Sin it ſelf their Ordinary Calling and Profeſſion. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Numbers, who inſtead of following an honeſt Employment, ſubſiſt only by the Sins which they commit themſelves, or which they make others commit. This might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96537:128"/>be proved by abundance of Inſtances. How many are there, whoſe Trade is a conſtant Practice of Obſcenity, Lewdneſs and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, of Artifice and Intrigue, Lying and Knavery? How many are there, who are profeſſed Uſurers and Cheats, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employed in Acts of Injuſtice, Cruelty and Violence? nay, there are Societies Form'd for that purpoſe; the Trade of Robing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Innocent, and that by committing Rapine by Sea and Land, is erected into an honourable and lawful Employment. Many Perſons are ſuffered at this Day among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe Profeſſion was formerly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Infamous: Many are tolerated, who are only Miniſters of Voluptuouſneſs, and whoſe only Buſineſs it is to introduce Licentiouſneſs of Manners, to corrupt the Youth by training them up to the love of Pleaſure, and to a Luxurious and Effeminate Life; and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe who are inclined to Debauchery, Senſuality, Idleneſs, or Gaming; with the Means to gratify their Inclinations. Now all theſe Profeſſions are not only inſeparable from Sin, but they likewiſe make way for all kinds of Vice among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>We ought to paſs almoſt the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the way of Living of thoſe, who without making a publick Profeſſion of Vice, propoſe no other end to themſelves in this World, but the pleaſing of their Appetites. Some have no other view, than to enjoy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96537:129"/>the Pleaſures of Life, and they level their whole Conduct at that Mark. Others deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to grow Rich, or to raiſe themſelves to Honours, make no ſcruple of uſing all the Means, which Intereſt, Ambition and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, have eſtabliſhed in the World. They make uſe of Fraud, Violence and Extortion; it is their Maxim and their Study to diſſemble their Sentiments, and to do miſchief to thoſe who ſtand in their way. In a Word, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to every thing that may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſucceſs of their Deſigns. Such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Life, is manifeſtly contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, and it muſt needs be highly ſinful, ſince both the End of it, and the Means uſed to obtain that End, are ſo.</p>
                  <p>There are other Kinds of Life, which do not ſeem altogether ſo bad, and yet are not much better. This may particularly be ſaid of Idleneſs. The Profeſſion of many, is to have none at all, and to be as little Employed as they can. They think it the happieſt of all Conditions, to have nothing to do, and to live at Reſt and free from Action. But yet it is unworthy of a Man, and much more of a Chriſtian, to be uſeleſs in the World. And if this Idleneſs is ſhameful and culpable in it ſelf, it is much more ſo in its Effects and Conſequences. It betrays Men into frivolous or dangerous Paſtimes. For a Man cannot be perfectly Idle. The want of uſeful Buſineſs muſt be ſupplied with Amuſements; and thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96537:129"/>Amuſements are generally ſinful. Thus we ſee Multitudes of People, who excepting the time which they muſt needs beſtow upon the Neceſſities of Nature, and upon ſome external and indiſpenſable Acts of Religion, conſume the beſt part of their Lives at Play, or in Diverſions, in unprofitable Reading and Converſations, in meeting Companies, in receiving or returning Viſits, or in other ſuch things, which tho' they are thought innocent, yet they enervate the Mind, they devour Time, they enſlave a Man to the Opinions and Modes of the World, and they make him moſt frequently tranſgreſs the Laws of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It would not be difficult to apply this to profeſſed Gameſters, to thoſe who ſpend their time in trifling Diſcourſes and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Viſits, and to many other Perſons. I might eaſily ſhew, if it was neceſſary, that ſuch a Life has little of Chriſtianity in it, and that it is a great deal more to blame, than is commonly believed.</p>
                  <p>Thus Men follow divers kinds of Life, which are eſſentially Bad, and wherein by Conſequence, Purity of Heart, and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Life, cannot be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe kinds of Life and Occupations which are Lawful, I might obſerve in the firſt place, that for the moſt part Men are too much wedded to them, and that they commonly abuſe them. But I will not preſs this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, having ſhewn already in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96537:130"/>Chapter, that too great application to Temporal Affairs, robs Men both of the Time, and of that Inclination and Freedom which are neceſſary to mind Spiritual Things, and that it makes them Dull, Earthly-minded, Senſual, and Slaves to their Paſſions. To ſpeak then only of what concerns particular Callings, I ſhall obſerve theſe Two general Faults.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a great Miſchief that Men embrace Profeſſions which are not fit for them. Every Profeſſion requires ſome particular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and Talents; and ſince all Men have not thoſe Qualifications, it follows that all Men are not fit for all Employments, and that Diſtinction and Choiſe are to be uſed in pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Profeſſion. The Welfare of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and of particular Perſons, does in a great meaſure depend upon that Choice. If no Care is taken of this, Employments muſt be ill diſcharged, and from thence a great many Diſorders will ariſe both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>Now if we take a Survey of the different Callings which Men are ingaged in, we will find that they are often deſtitute of thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which are neceſſary for the right diſcharging of them. And the worſt of it is, that this happens in the moſt conſiderable Employments, and in thoſe which might contribute moſt to the preſerving of Order, and the encouraging of Vertue in the World. As to Profeſſions of leſſer Importance, the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96537:130"/>Choice is much eaſier; every body almoſt is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them, and the Faults which may be committed there are not of great Conſequence. If a Husband-man does not well underſtand his Buſineſs, or a Mechanick his Trade, no great inconveniency will enſue from thence in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Society. But when publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the Hands of Men who are not Qualified for them, it is hard to tell how much Miſchief is occaſioned by it. Is it not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a lamentable thing, that ſo many Perſons ſhould dedicate themſelves to the Church, who want the Talents requiſite for ſo high a Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that ſo many who might do great Service in that Profeſſion do not embrace it? By this it happens that ſome of thoſe who are placed at the Helm in ſeveral Churches, want both Learning and Probity, and that Religion is very ill adminiſtred, ſo that the People being without Inſtruction or Conduct, live in Ignorance and Diſorder. The ſame may be ſaid of the Office of Magiſtrates, when it is entruſted to thoſe who are not proper for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lawful Callings may prove great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Corruption and Diſorder, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe who embrace them, and of the Publick, when they are ill exerciſed, when the Duties annexed to them, are neglected; when Men do not watch againſt the Temptations which are particular to them, and when they look upon them only as means to gratify their Inclinations, to get Money, to have a Rank,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96537:131"/>to gain Credit, or to humour ſome other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I might enter here upon many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but becauſe this would lead me too far, I ſhall confine my ſelf to a few Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>It would be very proper to ſpeak here of the Profeſſion of Church-men, and of the Office of Princes, Magiſtrates and Judges, and to ſhew how pernicious both theſe Kinds of Life prove often, not only to thoſe who are raiſed to them, but likewiſe to Church and State. But theſe Two Articles are of too great Moment, to be touched upon only by the by. They are Two General Springs of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which deſerve to be purpoſely handled, and which are to have a Place in the Second Part of this Book.</p>
                  <p>The Profeſſion of Military Men, is a kind of Life which corrupts vaſt Multitudes. I do not condemn the Profeſſion in general. It is Lawful, a Man may live in it like a Chriſtian and there are Perſons in Military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of a ſolid Vertue and an exemplary Piety. But it muſt be confeſſed, that the Number of thoſe Perſons is not great; and that for the generality, the Maxims and Deportment of the Men of that Profeſſion, agree very little with the Rules of Chriſtianity. Thoſe who follow the Employments of War, are for the moſt part Men of looſe and vicious Principles. Every body knows, that if on the one hand ſome good Men are found to embrace this Profeſſion, on the other hand it is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96537:131"/>Receptacle, and the laſt Shift, of Idle and Debauched People; and of thoſe who are over-whelmed, with Poverty and Miſery. Beſides, how do Men live in that Profeſſion? ſaving ſome few Diſorders which Military Diſcipline does not allow of, every thing is lawful there; I ſpeak of what is commonly obſerved. To ſpend their Life in Idleneſs and Gaming, is the leaſt Fault of Soldiers. Lewdneſs is a thing about which no great Scruple is made among them. The ſame might almoſt be ſaid of Injuſtice; it is well known that commonly Officers do not thrive but the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pay for it. I ſay nothing of unjuſt Wars, nor of the Cruelty and Inhumanity which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attend that kind of Life, becauſe I will not enlarge upon this Subject. But it is moſt certain, and every conſidering Perſon will own, that after the rate that Military men live almoſt every where; War is the School of Vice, and that the prodigious Number of thoſe, who follow that Employment, is one of the principal Cauſes of Corruption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>
                  <p>Commerce is one of the moſt Lawful and Neceſſary Profeſſions of Life. Not only So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but Religion it ſelf may reap great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from it. But yet this Calling has its Dangers and Temptations, and it is exerciſed by many in a way which is contrary to good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. As the only End of Traffick is Gain, and as the Opportunities of getting by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96537:132"/>Methods, which may be practiſed with impunity, offer themſelves every Day; ſo it is evident, that if a Merchant has not a ſtrict and well-informed Conſcience, and Vertue enough to reſiſt the perpetual Temptations to which his Calling expoſes him, he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Innocence, and violate every Minute the Rules of Juſtice and Equity, of Charity, Truth and Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>There are few Callings more innocent and more ſuitable to the Order which God did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh at firſt, than the Employments of thoſe who Exerciſe Mechanick Trades, and get their Livelyhood by bodily Labour. And yet this kind of Life proves to a great many an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Vice, becauſe they do not arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Temptations and Sins which are ordinary in thoſe Callings. It is almoſt the general Character of this Order of Men, to mind nothing but the World, to labour only for their Bodies, and to do nothing for their Souls. Hence it is, that they are Ignorant, that they know their Religion very little, that they are groſs, ſenſual, given to Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and ſeveral other Exceſſes. They are apt beſides, to be unjuſt and falſe. They make no Conſcience of doing their Work ill, of Lying, and detaining what is not theirs. There is a Thouſand petty Frauds and little knaviſh Tricks, uſed in every Trade, which are thought Innocent and Lawful ways of Gain. Now it is plain, that all this does not contribute a little towards Corruption.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:96537:132"/>
                  <p>What I have ſaid of the Employments of Life, may be applied to the different States Men are in, with relation to Age, Condition and their way of Living. All theſe are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions and circumſtances, which may divert them from their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Thus Youth has its particular Temptations. Young People are Vain, Preſumptuous, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, given to Pleaſure, violent and bold in their Paſſions. They are likewiſe Imprudent and Fickle, becauſe they want Knowledge and Experience. Being thus diſpoſed at that Age, they will almoſt infallibly, unleſs prevented by a good Education, Corrupt themſelves, and contract ill Habits, which will ſtick by them, as long as they live. Daily Experience ſhews us, that Youth ill ſpent is the Source of the Corruption of a great many for the reſt of their whole Life.</p>
                  <p>Old People are commonly Covetous, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, Suſpicious, wedded to the Opinions they have once embraced, and moſt deeply engaged in their vicious Cuſtoms. Their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are not ſo boiſterous, but they are more laſting and harder to be cured, than thoſe of Young People. And from this we may judge, that if Reaſon and Religion do not correct thoſe Faults of Old People; that Age, which ought chiefly to be employed in preparing for Death, will prove an Obſtacle to Piety and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The Rich as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves *,<note place="bottom">1 Tim. V. 17.</note> are proud
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96537:133"/>and high-minded; they are apt beſides to be ſlothful, they love to ſatisfie their Paſſions, are full of ſelf-love, minding themſelves in every thing, and being little affected with the Miſeries of others. So that Riches may eaſily ſpoil thoſe who poſſeſs them, and do actually ſpoil many.</p>
                  <p>The Poor are almoſt all of them Vicious, becauſe they are ignorant, forſaken from their Infancy, and grown up in Want and Idleneſs, and among bad Company. They have little Religion, they will live without Working, they are given to Stealing and Diſhoneſty. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy fills their Hearts, and they only keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of Duty, when they can do no miſchief.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who live un-confined and much in the World, have for the moſt part little of a Chriſtian Character. They lie open to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Temptations, and what is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in that kind of life, is, that a Man has no ſooner embraced it, but he thinks it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, lawful and neceſſary; he harkens no longer to the rules of Religion, he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, and governs himſelf only by the Maxims of the World. Others lead a retired Life, they avoid great Companies, and they ſeldom appear in Publick. That State may have its advantages, but it has its dangers too. Thoſe who live thus retired, are apt to think themſelves much better than other Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Conduct ſeems regular and free
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96537:133"/>from Scandal; and this inſpires them with a ſecret Pride, a great Opinion of themſelves, an auſtere and imperious Humour, which makes them apt to ſpeak ill and to judge raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of other People, and this drives Charity, Gentleneſs and Humility out of their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>I think I have ſaid enough to ſhew, that Mens various kinds of Life, have a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Irregularities of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. But no make this Truth yet more evident, I ſhall add two Reflections to all that has been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That of all the Temptations which are apt to ſeduce Men, none are more dangerous than thoſe, which are, 1. Neceſſary and unavoidable. 2. Ordinary and frequent. 3. Hidden and imperceptible. Now the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations ariſing from Mens particular Callings have theſe Three Characters. 1. They are neceſſary and unavoidable, we may withſtand them, but we cannot avoid altogether being expoſed to them. 2. They are frequent and conſtant, thoſe Employments in which the greateſt part of our Lives is ſpent, offering them to us perpetually. 3. They are hidden and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible; for beſides that Men reflect little upon what is ordinary and happens every day; thoſe Temptations are varniſhed with the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretenſes of Example and Cuſtom, and even of the lawfulneſs of the Calling and of Neceſſity. Thus a Tradeſ-man, is neceſſarily expoſed to the danger of wronging his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96537:134"/>and of tranſgreſſing the Rules of Juſtice, Equity or Sincerity: The opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this returns every minute, and as often as he buys or ſells; this Temptation is impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and except he has a niceneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he will not be ſenſible of it, by reaſon that his Profeſſion is innocent, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to get, and that moſt of the unlawful ways of gain, are Authorized by Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second Reflection is, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the moſt inſuperable Obſtacles to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, proceed, for the moſt part, from a Man's Calling. It is that which obſtructs more than any thing elſe, the effect of the Goſpel, and Men's Converſion. We Preach, we Exhort to Repentance, But to whom do we ſpeak? We ſpeak to Men engaged in Profeſſions, which, conſidering how they behave themſelves in them, divert them from Piety, and furniſh them with a thouſand Opportunities of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. We ſpeak to People who have choſen already the Courſe of their whole Life; who are reſolved to continue in the ſtate they are in, and to alter nothing in it; and who have formed to themſelves, that Scheme of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which they intend to follow at any rate. We Preach to People who arc no ſooner out of the Church, but they meet at home and in their ordinary Buſineſs, with perpetual hindrances to Holineſs, and with Temptations, which it is certain they will not withſtand. Such Hearers may be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96537:134"/>to long enough, before they reap any fuit from what they hear. Sermons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gone; but the Temptations ariſing from the Profeſſions which Men chuſe, are continual, and laſt as long as their Lives. They accompany a Man every where, he is not jealous of them, he ſeeks them, he gives up himſelf to them, and he fancies he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do ſo. This is the viſible occaſion of the Goſpels having ſo little Efficacy upon Mens Minds.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which may ſerve for a Remedy againſt this Source of Corruption. 1. Every one ought to examine the ſtate and kind of life he is in; that if this State has ſomething in it that is evil, or contrary to the Duty of a Chriſtian, he muſt alter and correct it. If the Profeſſion is bad in it ſelf, nothing elſe can be done, but to quit it. If it is lawful, we muſt take care not to render it dangerous or ſinful, either by neglecting the Duties to which it obliges us, or by not avoiding the ſnares and Temptations that attend it, or by making it an Occaſion and Pretenſe, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our inordinate Affections. I confeſs we may meet here with difficulties. It is hard for a Man to leave off a Profeſſion, to go out of his ordinary road of Life, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſome Engagements when they are once formed. And yet this ought and may be done, if thoſe Engagements are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96537:135"/>It is better we ſhould offer ſome violence to our ſelves, by breaking them off, or by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting what is amiſs in them, than to run our ſelves into infinite Miſeries. But the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is to obviate the Evil in its beginning.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I ſay, 2ly. That ſince People uſe to reſolve upon a Profeſſion while they are young; that Choice requires a great deal of Prudence and Caution; for no leſs than Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal Happineſs or Miſery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. But it is a ſad thing to ſee, how raſhly and inconſiderately this matter is gone about. Intereſt, Chance, Paſſion, the Humour of Parents or of young People, are the things which determine ſo important a choice. It is not much conſidered whether a Calling is lawful, or proper for him that embraces it; little or no care is taken to form the Inclinations of Young Perſons; they are given up to their own Conduct, and to all the Temptations of that Profeſſion to which they are deſtined. And thus we need no longer wonder, why Employments are ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, why moſt People loſe their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in them, and why there is a general Corruption to be obſerved, in all States and Conditions. This is the Ordinary Effect and Conſequence of Mens particular Callings.</p>

But yet we muſt confeſs, that the various Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time, Plate, and of the State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contribute much to the progreſs of Piety or of Corruption in the World.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96537:137"/>to Piety; as on the other hand there are unhappy Circumſtances and Times in which it is like a Stranger upon Earth, the Means to promote it being then neither ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual nor ſo frequent. The deſign of this Work, obliges me to conſider, what may be thought in this reſpect of the time we live in, and whether this Corruption which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Chriſtianity, does not proceed from the unhappineſs of the Times, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the Church and Religion.</p>
                  <p>But we cannot ſucceed in this Enquiry, nor paſs a ſound judgment upon; the preſent ſtate of Religion, without running back to its firſt Origin and Nature, and without taking a view of thoſe Ages which are elapſed, ſince its firſt Eſtabliſhment. The Knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of Hiſtory are here of great uſe. The Scripture informs us what the ſtate of Religion ſhould be, and Hiſtory ſhews us the different ſtates through which it has paſſed. When we examine Religion by theſe two Rules, we perceive that it neither has been, nor will be, always in the ſtate it is now in.</p>

                     <hi>The houſe of the living God, a holy Nation, and the aſſembly of the firſt born which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven.</hi> They give to Chriſtians, the glorious Titles of Kings, Prieſts, Saints, Elect, Children of God, and New Men; They ſpeak of them, as of a People ſeparated from the World and its Vices, dedicated to God and to good Works, and living in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety, Temperance, Juſtice, Charity and all other Vertues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Union and Love is the third Character of the Church and of the true Diſciples of Chriſt. The Scripture does not ſpeak to us of many Churches but of one, of which all the Faithful are Members, in what place ſoever
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96537:138"/>they may be. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that there is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>one Faith, one Baptiſm, and one God;</hi> the Apoſtles enjoyn above all things, Union and Charity, and they give many Precepts to maintain theſe, and to make them flouriſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As Holineſs and Union cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, where there is no Order; ſo the Church was to be a well regulated Society, in which every thing might be done in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and orderly manner. And in fact, there are in the Sacred Writings many Laws to this purpoſe. We find there ſeveral regulations, concerning the way in which the Church ought to be governed, and concerning the calling of Biſhops and Paſtors, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Functions of their Office. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does beſides appoint the exerciſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the manner of proceeding in relation to ſcandalous Sinners, and the Adminiſtration of Publick Alms. It preſcribes the chief acts of Religion and Divine Worſhip, Prayers, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sacraments, Preaching, and ſome other Heads. All theſe Laws are deſigned to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Order and Piety in the Church, and to baniſh Confuſion and Scandals out of it. And this order cannot be a thing indifferent, ſince the Apoſtles have given us Laws about it.</p>
                  <p>It is not difficult to ſhew that moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Societies are hardly to be known by theſe Marks. But before we come to that, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve the different States through which the Church has paſſed from her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this time.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:96537:138"/>
                  <p n="2">II. If we conſider the Church in her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we muſt acknowledge, that the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity were very pure, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the following. But yet muſt take heed, when we ſpeak of the purity of the Primitive Church, that we do not form to our ſelves too advantagious an Idea of it, as if Chriſtianity had been then in its utmoſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Perfection. The Church in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings did conſiſt of Jews and Heathens. Theſe Men embracing Chriſtianity; did not ſo entirely ſtrip themſelves of their Prejudices and Cuſtoms, but that they brought with them into the Church, ſome of the Notions of Judaiſm, and even of Gentiliſm. It is well known that this was the firſt occaſion of thoſe Hereſies which did ſtain the Purity of the Chriſtian Doctrines, and Morals; and the cauſe of ſeveral diſorders, which happened in the very Times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Beſides, the Apoſtles and the firſt Miniſters of the Chriſtian Religion, were not able, by reaſon of the Perſecution and of the obſtacles they met with, to regulate all things as they would have done, if the Church had been in peace. We need not therefore wonder if we find Imperfections and Defects apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in the ſtate of the Primitive Church. And it is of ſome importance, to obſerve this, not only that we may have true apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning this matter, but that we may beſides obviate an unhappy Conſequence, which might be drawn in favour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96537:139"/>Corruption, from what has been known in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. No doubt but there were Diſorders and Scandals at that time; but we are to remember, that the Church was then made up of Men, who for the moſt part were born, and had lived in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, and whoſe life had been ſpent in the thickeſt darkneſs of Ignorance and Vice.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all that the Church was then more holy and pure than ſhe has been ſince, or is at this day in moſt places. This is matter of fact which cannot reaſonably be conteſted; for beſides that it may be verified, from the Teſtimony which the Sacred, and ſome of the Heathen Authors bear to the Innocency of the Primitive Chriſtians, and that it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Men were kept in awe while the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were alive in the time of Miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidesall this I ſay, there are two Conſidereations which prove, that Corrupton could not be then ſo great or ſo general, as it is now.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations are founded upon two undeniable Facts. 1. That the Church was then perſecuted; And 2. That Diſcipline was then exerciſed in it. Theſe were two powerful Means to remove Vices and Scandals from the Church. We may eaſily imagine, that Men who loved the World and their ſins, would not have embraced Chriſtiany at a time, when whoſoever became a Chriſtian, did by that very thing expoſe himſelf to Perſecution, Torments and Death. This did fright away the greateſt numbers of Wicked and Impious
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96537:139"/>Perſons. But if any of theſe entred into the Church, Diſcipline for the moſt part drove them out, when they made themſelves noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by a Scandalous life. It is eaſy to judge, that in ſuch Circumſtances there was more Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at that time, than we obſerve now in the Church. The firſt Chriſtians were ſincere in their Profeſſion. Being inſtructed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and apoſtolical Men, they placed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion chiefly in a good Life, to which they did ſolemnly engage themſelves by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. They were united among themſelves; they governed themſelves in matters of Order and Diſcipline by the Preſcripts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as much as the Perſecution gave them leave; and they did with Courage lay down their lives for the Truth. Such was the Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the firſt Ages.</p>
                  <p>But the Church did not continue long in that State before this Zeal of thoſe Primitive Chriſtans began to cool. On the one hand Perſecution ceaſed, and on the other, the Ancient Diſcipline was ſlackned. Theſe two Fences being pluckt up, and the Emperors turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian, the Corruption of the World broke in upon the Church. Divers abuſes crept into Doctrine, Diſcipline, Worſhip and Manners, till the Church fell at laſt, into ſuch a Diſmal Darkneſs of Ignorance, Superſtition and Vice, that Chriſtianity ſeemed almoſt quite extinct and deſtroyed. All thoſe who had any true ſenſe of Religiion did lament this; they complained openly of it, and they longed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96537:140"/>for a good Reformation. This was the State which the Church and Religion were in, for ſome Centuries.</p>
                  <p>It did not pleaſe God that thoſe Times of Ignorance ſhould laſt for ever; that Darkneſs began to be diſperſed in the laſt Century. Then it was that Learning and Languages revived, and that the Holy Scripture, which had been for a great while, a Book unknown to the People, was reſcued out of that obſcurity, in which the Barbariſm of former Ages had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it. Men did perceive that divers Errors had been introduced into Religion; they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſeveral Abuſes, they went about to redreſs them, and they ſucceeded ſo far, that in this reſpect, Chriſtianity was reſtored to its Purity. But that great Work could not be finiſhed; ſo that at this Day they Church and Religion, are not yet brought to that State of Perfection which they might be in.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. For to come now to the preſent State of Religion, it is certain, Firſt that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches are ſtill very near in the ſame Darkneſs, Men were in ſome Ages ago. I ſhall ſay nothing of the ſinking of Chriſtianity in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> there is more Knowledge in <hi>Europe;</hi> but yet in many Places we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve almoſt all thoſe Diſorders, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the Times of the groſſeſt Ignorance. Nay, our Age is more unhappy than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, in that thoſe Abuſes have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirmed and authorized by Laws, and are now ſupported by Force. How many Countries and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96537:140"/>Churches are there, where the People know almoſt nothing of the Goſpel, where Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is reduced to Childiſh and Superſtitious Devotions and Practices, where the moſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous things are believed, and the moſt ſhameful Errors received; where the looſneſs of Manners may almoſt be parallel'd with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, where the moſt execrable Crimes are committed? In a Word, where the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both of the People and Clergy are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, excepting only ſome few underſtanding Men who are ſenſible of theſe Diſorders, but are reſtrained by Fear from diſcovering their Sentiments. From thoſe Places Corruption ſpreads to others, and it would not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſhew by ſeveral Inſtances, that the Cauſe of Impiety, Ignorance and Vice, is to be found in thoſe Places which ſhould be the Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tains of Piety and Religion.</p>
                  <p>What I have now ſaid, is not to be applied to all Churches; for ſome there are, where Religion is not ſo corrupted, and where a purer Chriſtianity is profeſſed. But yet let us enquire in the ſecond place, whether there are any Chriſtian Societies, where nothing is Want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or to be deſired in the State of the Church and Religion, and where it would not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make ſome Alterations and Conſtitutions, in order to come nearer to Perfection. This deſerves to be examined with Care, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prepoſſeſſion. We ought here to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Spirit of a Party, and ingenuouſly to acknowledge Defects where they are. For elſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96537:141"/>if every one is wedded to the Society of which he is a Member, nothing can ever be remedied. For ſuppoſing that there are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, what Remedy can be uſed, if we are all poſſeſſed with This Prejudice, that all is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in our Society? Is not this the way to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize Abuſes, and to prevent the reſtoring of Order?</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, we ought not to wonder, if there ſhould ſtill be Imperfections in the pureſt Societies. It would be a kind of Miracle, if there were none remaining. God does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think fit to finiſh his Work all at once; unleſs he had made uſe of Inſpired Men, ſuch as the Prophets or the Apoſtles were. It was impoſſible ſo to attain Perfection and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for every thing at firſt daſh, that nothing more ſhould be deſired. Beſides, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſo much altered, that it ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to change ſeveral things that were left in the laſt Age. It is further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that tho' Chriſtians did long for a good Reformation, yet great Difficulties were to be overcome to bring it about. Mens Minds were not much enlightened, they were juſt creeping out of Darkneſs, and a long Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom had almoſt obliterated the true Ideas of Religion. Almoſt all thoſe who were in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or Eccleſiaſtical Authority, did obſtinately defend the Abuſes which all Good Men thought it neceſſary to Redreſs. Extream Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity was uſed towards thoſe who deſired this Reformation of the Church. All this did
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96537:141"/>terrify a great many well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and was the cauſe, that in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe who had Courage enough to Condemn the Abuſes openly, were not able for want of Means, to do all that the Intereſt of Religion required. They were fain in thoſe Places to yield ſomething to the Iniquity of the Times, and to ſettle Things as well as they could till a more favourable Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Some Churches came nearer to Perfection than others. But howſoever, if we would paſs a right Judgment upon the preſent State of the Church and Religion, we ought to Examine the Thing in it ſelf, and without Partiality. Upon this I ſhall offer here ſome general Conſiderations, and refer to the following Chapter ſome Heads, which will requirean exact and particular Diſcuſſion. I will firſt reſume the Four Characters, which the Scripture gives us of the Chriſtian Church and Religion; which are, Truth, Holineſs, Union and Order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All Chriſtian Societies boaſt that they profeſs the Truth; and that very thing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſhew that many of them are in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſince they do not agree among themſelves about the Articles to be believed. I will not enlarge on this Head, becauſe it would lead me into many Particulars, and in ſome reſpect, into Controverſy. I ſhall only ſay, that if we did judge of what is to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Religion, by that which ought to be the Principle and Rule of Faith among
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96537:142"/>Chriſtians, I mean, the Holy Scripture, we would ſoon perceive on which ſide the Truth lies. We might obſerve in that Society which vaunts it ſelf to be the pureſt of all and which even pretends to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the only True Church excluſive of all other, abſurd Tenets and monſtrous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, equally repugnant to Scripture and Reaſon, and we ſhould be convinced, that the Doctrine of thoſe Churches which did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from that Society, is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt have a very mean Notion of Chriſtianity, if we can believe that Holineſs, which is the ſecond Character of the Church, is to be found among Chriſtians at this time. The complaint of the laſt Ages was, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion wanted to be Reformed, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Manners. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in part by the rejecting of thoſe Errors and Abuſes, which were crept into Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline; but the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Manners is ſtill behind. The People have not as yet been Reformed in this regard, except perhaps in thoſe Times and Places where they have been Perſecuted. As for the reſt, they have ſcarce changed any thing beſides their Belief and Worſhip; this alone proves that the State of the Church is yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Holineſs is the Scope of Religion, it is the chief Character of Chriſtianity; ſo that where Holineſs and purity of Manners is not, Religion muſt be very defective.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:96537:142"/>
                  <p n="3">III. Union Peace and Charity, as was ſaid before, are one of the eſſential Marks of the Diſciples and Church of Chriſt. But where is this Character to be found? The Church at this Day is Rent into Factions and Parties. We cannot ſay, that there is but one Church; we muſt ſay, that there are many Religions and Churches. Chriſtians divide not only upon Lawful Grounds, which make Separation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but about things of ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Upon the leaſt diverſity of Opinions, they pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt one another, form different Sects and Communions. Even thoſe Churches which might have a common Belief and Intereſt are not united. Thoſe Men who by their Office ſhould be the Miniſters of Peace, are but too often the Fire-brands of Diviſion. I deſire no other Proof of this, but that Zeal which moſt Divines expreſs about the Diſputes of Religion, and that little Diſpoſition which is found among them, to ſacrifice ſome Opinions, or Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to the Peace of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I do not condemn all Diſputes without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, for ſome are neceſſary. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles command the Rulers of the Church, to eſtabliſh with Care, Pure Doctrine, and to Confute thoſe who endeavour to corrupt it. They did themſelves on many Occaſions Diſpute againſt falſe Teachers. To deſert the Truth when attacked, were to make but little account of it: This would be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Intereſt of Piety, ſince Piety is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96537:143"/>founded upon Truth. Diſputes become neceſſary, when Eſſential Truths are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Neither would I reduce all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or lawful Diſputes, to thoſe only which concern Fundamentals. There are Errors, which tho' not Mortal, yet are dangerous, and ſo it is needful to oppoſe them: And there are Truths, which tho' not Fundamental, are yet of great uſe in Religion, and may ſerve to confirm the Principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is fit that ſuch Truths ſhould be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, provided this be done with Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>I only blame uſeleſs Diſputes, or theſe, which tho' they may have their uſe, yet are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thoſe Paſſions and Diſorders, which blind Zeal inſpires. Such Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which are but too common, are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatal to Religion. We are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what Miſchiefs they occaſion in the Church, and how prejudicial they are to the progreſs of Chriſtianity in general, and of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in particular. It may ſeem at firſt, that becauſe the People do not take cognizance of theſe Conteſts, they ſhould prove hurtful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe Learned Men by whom alone they are managed; but yet the whole Church feels the ill Effects of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By reaſon of theſe Diſputes, the People are deſtitute of Edification, or at leaſt they do not receive all the Edification which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Church-men being only full of theſe, Study and Meditate upon nothing elſe; in their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96537:143"/>Sermons they ſpeak only of theſe Matters, which take them up, and which ſeem capital to them They have neither Leiſure nor Inclination to mind things of another Nature, and to ſet about Reforming the Manners of Chriſtians; or they do it but faintly and careleſly. Whilſt a Miniſter is very buſy in his Study or Pulpit, about Confuting an Adverſary whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, or an Error which is unknown to his whole Flock, his Sheep are loſt, his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers remain poſſeſt with mortal Errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Morality, and ingaged in the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Habits. This is the Fruit of moſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, they occaſion the Ruin, rather than the Edification of the Hearers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſputes keep up among Chriſtians falſe Zeal, Hypocriſy and Licentiouſneſs. The People learn by the Example of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to place their Zeal, not in oppoſing Vice, but in underſtanding Controverſy, in adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to certain Opinions, and in bearing a ſtrong Hatred to thoſe who diſſent from them. They judge that what makes the ordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Divines, what they inſiſt moſt upon, what kindles their Zeal, and excites in them the moſt violent Paſſions, muſt needs be the moſt important thing in Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes the People take part in the Quarrels of their Teachers, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unavoidable Animoſities and Diviſions, which extinguiſh Love, and the Spirit of Chriſtianity, and which create inſuperable Obſtacles to the Peace of the Church, and the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96537:144"/>Re-union of Chriſtians. Of this we have but too many Inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, the little Union which is in the Church, is one of the great Cauſes of the ſmall Progreſs of Chriſtianity. Chriſtians inſtead of making their Religion appear Lovely and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, to <hi>Jews</hi> and Infidels, expoſe it to their Contempt. Inſtead of endeavouring to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Chriſtian Faith, and to deſtroy Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, they turn their own Weapons againſt themſelves; they mind nothing but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Intereſt of their particular Sects, and they neglect that of Chriſtianity in-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. On the other hand, Unbelievers, ſeeing that Chriſtians are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take occaſion from thence to Queſtion every thing, and they judge that there can be nothing but uncertainty and obſcurity in a Religion, where there is nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy and different Opinions.</p>
                  <p>The want of Union is then, a moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Imperfection in the preſent State of the Church. It were to be wiſhed, that ſome Remedy might be applied to ſo great an Evil, and that thoſe Controverſies which produce and cheriſh it, might be turned out of Doors. The way to compaſs this, would be to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in good earneſt, the Reforming of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the reſtoring of Order. This great and noble Deſign will no ſooner be purſued, but Men will be aſhamed of all theſe Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they will look upon them as trifling Amuſements, and find no reliſh in thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96537:144"/>which to ſay the truth, do only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſuch Perſons as are conceited with vain Learning, and narrow-ſpirited Men, who are not capable of larger and higher Views.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If we examine the preſent State of the Church with relation to Order, there we muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that great Defects are to be found. In Matters of Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Chriſtians ought to Regulate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Firſt by the Laws which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſet them; and then by the Example of the Primitive Church and of the Pureſt Antiquity, it being evident, that what has been practiſed in the Firſt Ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and does beſides agree with the Rules and the Spirit of the Goſpel, ſhould have a great regard paid to it, by all Chriſtians. Now it cannot be denied, but that moſt Churches, have conſiderably departed from that Ancient Order.</p>
                  <p>To prove this by ſome Inſtances, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in fact, that the Eccleſiaſtical Order and Government, which obtains in many Places, is not ſuch as it ought to be. None ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n be ignorant of this, but thoſe who are altogether unacquainted with Antiquity, or who being full of Prejudices find what they pleaſe in Scripture, and Church-Hiſtory. Can it be ſaid, that the Elections of Biſhops or Paſtors, are Canonical, as they are managed in many Places, arid that the Practice and Order, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Apoſtles and the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are obſerved every where? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96537:145"/>likewiſe, that all Churches are not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſufficient Number of Perſons, to perform Divine-Service and to Inſtruct and Edify the People. When we look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Primitive Church, we find, that tho' it was poor and perſecuted, yet it had its Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, its Prieſts, its Catechiſts and its Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. At this time we ſee yet in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that one ſingle Town maintains a great Number of Church-men, who indeed, for the moſt part, are very inſignificant; but elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where it is quite otherwiſe, one ſingle Man does often perform all the Eccleſiaſtical Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nay, ſometimes many Churches have but one Paſtor. This Diſorder as well as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, proceeds partly from the want of neceſſary Means and Funds, to ſupply the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of all Churches. Here it might be proper to ſpeak of the Paſtoral Functions, and of the Adminiſtration of Diſcipline; but theſe Two Heads being important, I reſerve what I have to ſay about them, for the Two next Chapters.</p>
                  <p>We ought here not to omit the want, of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Correſpondence among Churches. If they had more Communication and Intercourſe one with another, great Advantages would follow from thence. Right Meaſures might be taken for the Edification of the People, and for the Redreſſing of Abuſes and Scandals; that Uniformity which is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, both in Worſhip, and in Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Diſcipline, might be eſtabliſhed:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96537:145"/>And that would contribute much to the Honour and Safety of Religion in general. The Church would appear then like a well-ordered Society, and like One Body, of which all the Parts ſhould maintain a relation to and a ſtrict depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon one another. On the other hand, it is a great unhappineſs, when Churches have little or no Intercourſe or Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one with another, ſo that every one orders its Matters and Cuſtoms, the Form of its Worſhip and Government, within it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus in many reſpects, it would be eaſie to ſhew, that Things are not altogether Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Church, as they ought to be, with relation to Order. Men are not ſenſible of theſe Defects, becauſe they are apt to judge of Religious Matters, by the Practice of the preſent Time, and by the Cuſtoms of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Countries; beſides, that Antiquity is but little known. And yet theſe Defects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more than is commonly imagined, to the decay of Piety and Zeal. The want of Order in any Society, does moſt certainly bring Confuſion and Licentiouſneſs into it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Worſhip of God being the end and the eſſence of Religion, we cannot but inquire whether all things are well regulated with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that. To ſpeak here only of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, it would be very neceſſary, that it ſhould be performed every where in ſuch a manner, that the People might underſtand, the moſt eſſential parts of Religion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip to be Adoration, Praiſe, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96537:146"/>the invocation of God; and that the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of theſe Duties is the end of Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. I remark this particularly, becauſe in many places, Devotion is placed only in the hearing of Sermons. Churches are properly nothing elſe but Auditories. People fancy that Sermons are the chief thing they meet for, and that preaching is the principle Function to be exerciſed by Miniſters in the Church. The Prayers and the Pſalms, are looked upon only as Preliminaries or Circumſtances to a Sermon. This is a dangerous Notion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on the one hand it makes Chriſtians neglect Divine Service, and on the other it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Religion contemptible, when Sermons are not ſo edifying as they ſhould be, which happens but too often. And therefore it would not perhaps be amiſs, if as it is practiſed in ſeveral Churches, Divine Service was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from Sermons by ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of times or perſons; ſo that it might be one thing to celebrate Divine Service, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to hear Sermons.</p>
                  <p>Several Reflections might be offered here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the principal things relating to Publick Worſhip, ſuch as Forms of Prayers, Liturgies, the Manner of praiſing God, and Sacred Hymns. It would be a queſtion worth the examining, whether we ought in Chriſtian Churches, to uſe only Pſalms and Canticles, out of the Old Teſtament, among which tho' ſome are moſt edifying and full of excellent expreſſions of Piety; yet there are many which relate altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96537:146"/>to ſome particular paſſages of thoſe times; or if they ſpeak of Chriſt, it is only in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical ſtyle, very obſcure to the People. One would think that Chriſtian Hymns, which ſhould be ſung to the honour of God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, chiefly to celebrate the Wonders of our Redemption, might be extraordinary uſeful, to nouriſh Piety and to ſtir up Devotion, as well as more agreeable to that, which the Apoſtles preſcribe, and which the Primitve Chriſtians practiſed in their Aſſemblies. Would it not likewiſe be neceſſary to agree about giving the Holy Sacrament to ſick and dying Perſons; and to reſtore the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of the Euchariſt, acpording to the practice of the Apoſtles and of the Primitive Church? Faſting being enjoyned by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and eſtabliſhed by the example of the Apoſtles, and by the univerſal practice of the firſt Chriſtians, and of all the Churches in the World for ſeveral Ages; there is reaſon to wonder that in ſome places this Duty ſhould be almoſt out of date. For as to ſolemn Faſts, which are celebrated from time to time, and ſeldom enough; thoſe are not properly the Faſts of which the Goſpel ſpeaks, and which were obſerved by the Ancients: They are Acts of publick Humiliation, deſigned for times of Calamity, or of extraordinary Devotion, and the uſe of theſe ought not to be too frequent, becauſe Cuſtom is apt to leſſen their effect. But I mean thoſe Faſts which are helps to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Holineſs, and Means to mortify the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96537:147"/>Body, and to diſpoſe Men to Humiliation and Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Uniformity in Divine Worſhip would be another very neceſſary Eſtabliſhment. It would ſhew the unity of Faith, it would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Religion venerable, and prevent thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Confuſions, which are inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when Rites and Practices quite different, nay ſometime contrary to one another, are obſerved in ſeveral Churches.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Care ſhould be taken, that divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice might be performed every where, in an orderly grave and decent manner. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of Religion, has a greater influence than we imagine, upon the eſſence of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we ſave an expreſs Law,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. XIV. 40.</note> Which ſays, <hi>that all things ſhould be done decently and in order.</hi> Indeed, Pageantry and Pomp, the great number of Ceremonies, and whatever ſavours of Superſtition, ought to be avoided, as well as every thing which is contrary to the eſſence of Evangelical Worſhip: And it were better to fall into an exceſs of Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to Clog Religion with too many Ceremonies. But yet under pretence of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, we are not to run into Confuſion, and to neglect the externals of Religion and Divine Service. If we ſhould examine by this Rule what is done in ſome Churches, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for inſtance, to the Laws and Forms of Publick Aſſemblies, to the celebration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip and the Sacraments, and to the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96537:147"/>Perſons who receive the Communion, and who officiate; we might find there ſeveral things to be rectified. And it would be very uſeful to take this into Conſideration, for the want of Gravity and Decency, and a dry and careleſs performing of Publick Worſhip, render Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſpicable, and make the People, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly judge of things by their Outſides, to entertain a mean notion of divine Service; which produces the contempt of Religion, and by conſequence ill Manners.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. This contempt of Religon is another Fault, which ought not to be paſſed over in ſilence. It has been always the general ſenſe of Mankind, that Religion is to be honoured and reſpected. The Heathen Religions, as falſe as they were, did attract the Veneration of the People; and the ſame may be ſeen at this day, among the ſeveral Nations of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Certainly then the Chriſtian Religion deſerves all the veneration and reſpect, which Men are capable of. But it muſt be confeſſed that in many places, it is falling of late, into a very great outward meanneſs. Men are accuſtoming themſelves, to look with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and with haughtineſs and ſcorn upon every thing, which has ſome relation to the Church or to Religion. This appears eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the contempt, which is expreſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Clergy. Tho' the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents their Office, as a moſt Excellent and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Imployment; tho' it enjoyns Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96537:148"/>to<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. XIII. 27. 1 Theſſ. V. 13.</note> Honour, Love and Reverence thoſe, who have the rule over them; yet the Eccleſiaſtical Order is generally but little honoured: And what is more ſurprizing, it is moſt depreſſed and abaſed, in thoſe Churches which otherwiſe, profeſs a purer Doctrine and Worſhip, than other Chriſtian Societies. I do not ſpeak of all Churches in general; but whoever ſees what is practiſed in many places, would be apt to think, that it was a part of the Reformation of the Church, to ſtrip the Clergy of all Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and of every thing that might render them venerable to the People, and to ſet them upon a low and contemptible Foot. Their Character is become Abject, if not Odious, and it becomes ſo more and more every day. That which makes it more deſpicable, is the Poverty which many of them are forced to live in.</p>
                  <p>It is not difficult to find out the Grounds of this Contempt. It may be juſtly charged upon the Clergy themſelves, their Character is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile, becauſe they ſupport; it but it does not follow that Men have a Right to deſpiſe them; all that is to be done, is to endeavour the reclaiming of them. If under pretence of Perſons being unworthy, or of ſome abuſe in Offices, it was lawful to deſpiſe the Profeſſions themſelves, would not even Magiſtracy be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the vileſt of all employments? May we not ſay beſides, that Church-Men do not well maintain their Character, becauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed?
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96537:148"/>An Office which is ſlighted will never be well diſcharged; it is ſeldom that great worth is to be found in a Poſt which is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honoured, or rather much deſpis'd.</p>
                  <p>The chief Cauſe of this Contempt was the manner in which things were ordered in the laſt Century. Perſecution, Poverty and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the higher Powers, were at firſt great Obſtacles to the eſtabliſhing of good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Princes and great. Men did poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Revenues and Authority of the Church. Nothing was left to Church-men, but the care of making Sermons, and of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments. They were turned into bare Preachers; a Character which for the moſt part, is not very fit to create Reſpect. I ſay nothing here of the Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, becauſe I am to ſpeak of theſe more largely by and by.</p>
                  <p>This Abaſement of Religion and of the Miniſtry, is a viſible Cauſe of Corruption. As ſoon as Sacred things are diſregarded, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety muſt needs prevail; eſpecially if the Miniſters of Religion are deſpiſed, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can have no great force upon Men's Minds. The Maſter cannot be honoured, when his Servants are ſlighted. Men, who are without Authority, cannot contain the People in their Duty, Whatſoever comes from an abject Perſon, who is neither beloved nor eſteemed, can never be received with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The contempt of Paſtors, draws of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96537:149"/>neceſſity after it the contempt of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, of Preaching, and of other Sacred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>The Poverty of Church-men, is not much leſs fatal to the Church, than the immenſe and exceſſive Riches which did formerly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Clergy. For beſides, that in thoſe times and places in which the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is predominant, and profeſſed by Perſons of Quality, Poverty makes the Miniſters of Religion Contemptible to the People, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Great Men, it being certain that in thoſe Circumſtances, it is neceſſary that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould live with ſome credit; beſides this I ſay, that Poverty diſables them from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Hoſpitality, from minding their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they ought, and from diſcharging the Duties of it with Authority and Zeal. It forces them to have recourſe to ſeveral mean or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Methods to ſupply their Neceſſities, and thoſe of their Families, and to do many things which do not comport with their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. From thence proceeds likewiſe the want of able Miniſters. A great many Perſons who might have the neceſſary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, Qualifications and Means, to be very uſeful in the Church, take a diſguſt at that Profeſſion, by the fear of Contempt or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. As long as things are in this ſtate, Religion will be deſpiſed, and Corruption will ſtill be in vogue.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo eaſie to remove this Cauſe of Corruption as it is to deteſt it. The re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96537:149"/>of Order, ſeems to be a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult. To this end it would be requiſite, that Princes arid Church-men ſhould act in Conjunction. But there are few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes who lay this to heart, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have quite other things in their thoughts; Their great buſineſs is to maintain what is eſtabliſhed, and to diſpute with thoſe who find fault with it. On the other hand, Knowledge or Reſolution is wanting, and there is not enough of honeſty or greatneſs of Soul, to confeſs the Truth. Few Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have the Courage to ſpeak ſo impartially, as the Famous Author of the Hiſtory of the Reformation in <hi>England</hi> has done, in the Preface to his Second Volume. It is thought by many Perſons, that all would be ruined if the leaſt alteration was made. Some of thoſe Defects which have been mentioned in this Chapter, are now become inviolable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Laws. Every body fancies true and pure Chriſtianity to be that which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his Country, or in the Society he lives in; and it is not ſo much as put to the queſtion, whether or not ſome things ſhould be altered. As long as Chriſtians are poſſeſſed with theſe Prejudices, we muſt not expect to ſee Chriſtianity reſtored to an entire Purity.</p>
                  <p>But yet it is to be hoped from the Grace of God, and the force of Truth, that Chriſtians will open their Eyes at laſt, and that Divines will grow ſenſible of the neceſſity of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Things. The main Point here is to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96537:150"/>ſhake off all Prejudice, and to conſider things in their Nature and Original. Our Saviour has left us an Excellent Rule, when ſpeaking of the Abuſes which had been ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in reference to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he tell us, <note>PLACE="foot" n="*" Mat. XIX.</note> 
                     <hi>That from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> This Maxim is of great uſe, and a lover of Truth and Vertue, ſhould always have it before his Eyes. It were to be wiſhed, that we ſhould ſtill appeal to it, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Governing our ſelves by the Cuſtom of the preſent Time, we ſhould run up to the Ancient Conſtitution, and compare what is done at this Day, with that which has been, and ought to be done. This would be the true Way to Reform Abuſes, and to draw near to Perfection, and to bring things back into the Natural and Primitive Channel.</p>

               <div n="2" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE II. The want of Diſcipline.</head>
                  <p>IT is not my Deſign in this Chapter to ſpeak of Church Diſcipline in general. I ſhall only inſiſt upon that Part of it, the End of which is to Regulate the Manners of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And this is an important Matter. The want of Diſcipline is one of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which have been obſerved in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96537:150"/>preſent State of the Church, and one of the moſt evident and general Cauſes of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Chriſtians. But becauſe ſome Men have pretended, that Diſcipline, ſuch as I ſuppoſe it in this Chapter, was a Humane and Arbitrary Inſtitution, the obſervation of which was not abſolutely neceſſary, and might be dangerous; I think it proper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, concerning the Original and the Neceſſity of the Diſcipline of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> It is certain in the firſt place, that all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and Bodies, have a Right to eſtabliſh an Order to Regulate themſelves by, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Security and Preſervation. When ſeveral Men or People, unite to Form a Body, they have Power to make Laws and Regulations, to which all the Members of that Body, may be tyed; and to exclude thoſe from their Communion, who will not ſubmit to them. But theſe Laws ought not to claſh with other Laws already eſtabliſhed, nor with juſt and acknowledged Rights. I think, this Power which is granted to the meaneſt of Societies, cannot be denied to the Church; and this proves already that the Church had a Right to Appoint a Diſcipline to which, all her Members ſhould he ſubject, provided, that Diſcipline did not on the one hand prejudice Publick Tranquility, and the Authority of the Magiſtrates; nor any ways contradict on the other hand, the Laws of the Goſpel. Now as Diſcipline is not liable to either of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, but does rather perfectly agree
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96537:151"/>with the welfare of Civil Society, and the Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion, as will be proved hereafter; ſo the eſtabliſhing of it, ſeems to be equally lawful and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But further, Diſcipline is an Order, which has God for its Author. We find the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in Holy Scripture, and in the Laws of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles; I ſhall recite the Chief of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel. <hi>Chap.</hi> XVIII. 15, 16, 17. We read theſe Words; <hi>If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him of his fault between thee and him alone: If he ſhall hear thee thou haſt gained thy Brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the Mouth of two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a Heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> For the right underſtanding of theſe Words, We muſt know, that our Saviour does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act here a new Law, and that an Order like that which is here preſcribed, was already obſerved among the <hi>Jews.</hi> But here, as upon many Occaſions, Our Saviour did comply with the Cuſtoms and Practice of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he judged that thoſe Cuſtoms were good, and fit for his views and purpoſes. The firſt Chriſtians did the ſame in matter of Order and Government, they did form the Chriſtian Church, upon the Model of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Aſſemblies, and upon the Method which was there obſerved.</p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:96537:151"/>
                  <p>This is the Key of the Place I have now quoted. Our Saviour approves the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and enjoyns his Diſciples to obſerve the ſame Order amongſt them. It cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that this was his Meaning. For he ſpeaks to his Diſciples, and it appears by all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Paſſage, and by the ſequel of his Diſcourſe, that he is giving here a Law, which concerns the Chriſtian Church. It is true indeed, that he properly ſpeaks of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate differences, but what he ſays ought to applied to all thoſe diſorders, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Church, and particularly to Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. And ſurely it is evident, that if we may proceed in the Methods here enjoined, when the Caſe is only concerning ſome differences between private Men, we have much more right to do ſo relation to with public Sins, ſince they are Caſes which Concern the whole Church, and that directly, and which do yet more properly belong to her Cogniſance, than the quarrels of private Men. The Meaning of Chriſt is then, that there muſt be an Order in his Church for the removing of Scandals. He ſuppoſes that the Church has a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe upon thoſe Occaſions, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that thoſe who ſhall refuſe to hear the Church, be looked upon as if they were her Members no longer, and that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with them ſhould be avoided: This is the import of theſe words, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man and Publican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The V. Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96537:152"/>the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ver. 2, 3, 4. decides this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having been informed, that there was a Man among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who lived in Inceſt, he writes about it to that Church; and firſt he reproves them, <hi>for not having cut off from their Communion, the perſon who had committed ſo Infamous an Action.</hi> In the next place he does himſelf Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that Man and deliver him up to Satan. I know that perhaps this Power of delivering up to Satan belonged only to the Apoſtles, and it is likely, that this was one of thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Puniſhments, which they had a Power to inflict upon Prophane and Rebellious Perſons. But as for Excommunication, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Right of the Church. This Right, or rather this Duty of the Church, is clearly aſſerted by the Cenſure which the Apoſtle addreſſes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> becauſe <hi>they had not taken that Inceſtuous Perſon from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> and becauſe they had not obſerved the Order he had given them before, not to ſuffer Fornicators;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 4.</note>

Here are particular Rules; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes an Adjuration to oblige <hi>Timothy</hi> to obſerve them. Theſe Laws do not concern <hi>Timothy</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Function, and of the Duty of the Paſtors of the Church in general.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96537:153"/>of that which he writes to <hi>Titus,</hi> to be ſatisfied that he intends this Order ſhould be ſettled in all the Churches.</p>
                  <p>Either there is nothing plain in Scripture, or it appears from all theſe Places, That Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is Inſtituted of God; that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it is committed to Paſtors; that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sinners are not to be tolerated in the Church; that private Men ought to avoid their Company; and that the Governors of the Church are bound to proceed againſt them, by private and publick Cenſures, and even by Excommunication. If the Paſſages I have cited do not prove all this, we may wrangle about every thing, and all Arguments from the Sacred Writings may be eluded. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sacraments is not more expreſs or poſitive.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But tho' theſe Places were not ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſo clear as they are, yet we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſured that this is their true meaning, becauſe this is the ſenſe in which the whole Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church underſtood them. The Practice of the Firſt Ages, in conjunction with the Laws of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles amounts to a Demonſtration, which cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; beſides that we are to preſume, that what has been practiſed from the Foundation of the Church, and in the time of Her Purity, was ſettled by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Men, ſo that we ought as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conform our ſelves to it. Now we know that Diſcipline was obſerved in the Primitive
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96537:154"/>Church, notwithſtanding the unhappineſs of the Times and the Perfecution. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable matter of fact, and therefore I ſhall take it for granted; and only ſay in ſhort, that then all thoſe who embraced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity were engaged by a ſolemn Vow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Vices of the Age, and to lead a holy Life; that thoſe who were Baptized were not ſuffered to live diſorderly; that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons were debarred the Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; that thoſe who fell into great Sins were Excommunicated, as well as thoſe who were Contumacious and Incorrigible; that ſuch were not reſtored to the Peace of the Church, but after various degrees of Penance, and a publick acknowledgment of their Faults; and that as to thoſe who relapſed, they were received only at the Hour of Death. Very clear Monuments of this Practice are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, in the Writings of the Ancient Doctors of the Church, as well as in the Old Canons and Decrees of Councils. This Diſcipline muſt needs have been very ſeverely obſerved, ſince St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was not afraid to put it in Practice againſt the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, that the Primitive Church has varied about certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the Penitents were treated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with more and ſometimes with leſs ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that the time of their Penance was lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or ſhorter: But as to the main or the eſſence of Diſcipline, it did always obtain in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church. And it was as little queſtioned then
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96537:154"/>Whether Diſcipline ought to be obſerved, as whether Chriſtians ſhould be Baptized. This uſage among the firſt Chriſtians is at leaſt a ſtrong preſumption in favour of Diſcipline; but it being conſonant beſides to what we read in the New Teſtament, I do not ſee how there can remain any doubt about this Matter.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In the laſt place, the Nature of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline it ſelf, proves the uſefulneſs and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it. All thoſe who are not blinded with Prejudice, muſt own, that Diſcipline conſidered in it ſelf, is altogether agreeable to the Spirit of Chriſtianity. 1. The honour of Religion, and the promoting of Chriſt's Kingdom, require Order in the Church. Who does not ſee but that if the Church did tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Scandalous Perſons and take them into her Boſom, and make no difference between them and the Faithful; She might juſtly be charged with all the Diſorders and Scandals, which are obſerved in the Lives of bad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and be looked upon by Infidels, as a Prophane Society, where Vice is permitted. But the Exerciſe of Diſcipline is an authentick diſowning of Vice, whereby the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares publickly that She does not allow of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſcipline is a moſt efficacious means, to procure the Converſion of Sinners. A Man muſt be very much hardened, when the being removed from the Communion of Chriſtians, does not reclaim him. But when a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſon is ſuffered to live in the Society of the Faithful, when he is admitted to the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96537:155"/>ſame Priviledges with other Members of the Church, this gives him an occaſion to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den himſelf in Sin, and to think that he is as good a Chriſtian, and that he has as much Right to Salvation as others, which is a moſt dangerous, but withal a moſt common Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diſcipline is uſeful to the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Many who may otherwiſe have ill Inclinations, are reſtrained by Example, or Shame, or Fear, or ever by Conſcience: Good Men are thereby doubly Edified; ſince on the one hand this Rigour confirms them in their Duty, and that on the other hand, it makes reparation for the Scandal which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Sins give them.</p>
                  <p>From all this, I conclude, that Diſcipline is a Sacred, Neceſſary and Inviolable Order. It cannot be ſaid, that it is a Humane, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Eſtabliſhment, which may be altered, or which was only to continue for a time. An Order which has its Original in the expreſs Laws of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and which is appointed in Scripture as a general Law; an Order which has been obſerved in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Apoſtolical Church; an Order which is founded upon the very Nature of the Church and Religion, and which perfectly agrees with the Spirit of the Goſpel; ſuch an Order certainly ought to be followed, as being of a neceſſary and indiſpenſable obligation. I ſay it again, there is nothing more poſitive than this in the Inſtitution of the Sacraments, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline as well as the Sacraments, is founded
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96537:155"/>upon Dvine Inſtitution, and confirmed by the practice of the Primitive Church; but in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline there is one thing more than in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; for whereas the Sacraments conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themſelves, and without reſpect to the divine Inſtitution, are things indifferent and of no uſe; Diſcipline in it ſelf is juſt and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, agreeable to the Principles of Chriſtianity as well as to plain reaſon and ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I have perhaps been too large upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but it was to be proved in the firſt place that Diſcipline is neceſſary and inſtituted by God, ſince that is the ground I go upon in this whole Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> This Sacred Order which had been fetled in the beginnings of Chriſtianity was altered in proceſs of time; And in this as in many other things Chriſtians grew remiſs. This was done by degrees; for good Laws are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aboliſhed all at once, but through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible changes. We learn from Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that the ſlackning of Diſcipline, is chiefly to be imputed to the taking away ſome publick Penances. Thoſe Penances were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into private Confeſſions and Penances. At firſt this alteration was only concerning ſome Sins, which were not thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the utmoſt rigor of Diſcipline; for as to great Sins, ſuch as Murder and Adultery, the Ancient Order was ſtill in force. But at laſt about the end of the IV. Century Publick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were Aboliſhed, firſt in the Eaſtern and ſometime after; in the Weſtern Churches. Inſtead of Penances, private Satisfactions were
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96537:156"/>appointed, and then Men unhappily began to be more concerned, about the exterior of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, than about what is Spiritual in it, and fit to reclaim Sinners. This was done at firſt by a kind of Relaxation or Indulgence; but that which at the beginning was no more than an exception to the Law, ſucceeded in the room of the Law it ſelf; and from thence ſprang Indulgences, Satisfactions, Penance, Auricular Confeſſion, and many other Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are but Corruptions of the Ancient Diſcipline. The Biſhops on the other hand being diſtracted by temporal Cares, after the Converſion of the Emperors to the Chriſtian Religion began to neglect the eſſential parts of their Function, and the Conduct of their Flocks. They were for humouring great Men, who thought it hard to ſubmit to the publick Order. This is a ſhort account, how the purity of the Chriſtian Religion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably adulterated in the point of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> We are now to examine what the preſent ſtate of the Church and Religion is, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Diſcipline. All the abuſes which came up in the room of the Ancient Diſcipline, do ſtill ſubſiſt in moſt places, both in the Greek and in the Latin Church. The Canons and Laws of the Church in the firſt Centuries have been abrogated by contrary Laws and Canons. This is acknowledged by all Men of Learning and Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee then whether this Diſcipline is
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96537:156"/>to be found any where elſe. There are many Churches in the laſt Age, which did redreſs thoſe Abuſes I now mentioned. But they ought to have gon further; as theſe Abuſes had ſucceeded in the room of Apoſtolical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, ſo that ſhould too have been reſtored, when theſe were taken away. But this was not done as it might have been wiſhed. The Diſorder was removed, but order was not re-eſtabliſhed; and it is not hard to apprehend how this came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder that thoſe Abuſes ſhould be taken away; they were grown too intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and they could not hold out againſt the Learning of an Age more knowing than the former were. Things were gone ſo far, that a Turn and a Revolution were neceſſary. It is very probable beſides, that Intereſt, Pride, or Ambition, did move great numbers of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who after all had hot much Piety, to ſet themſelves againſt thoſe many and great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to ſhake off a Yoke under which the Chriſtian World then groaned. But the ſame Principles hindred them to ſubmit to the Yoke of Chriſt, and to bind themſelves to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Evangelical Diſcipline. We are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further, that the Rules of Diſcipline and Penance had been diſuſed for ſeveral hundred Years, ſo that it was not eaſie to bring the World to ſubmit to an Order, of which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was loſt. Policy had perhaps a large ſhare likewiſe in this Revolution. Princes and great Men were eaſily determined, to pull down the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96537:157"/>exceſſive and uſurped Authority of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but they did not all expreſs the ſame Zeal to reſtore to the Church, her lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. In fine, among Divines themſelves, there were many who could not endure that Diſcipline ſhould be named, and who diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and writ againſt thoſe, who were for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſcandalous Perſons from the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and for making uſe of Excommuica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Publick Penances. In ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the reſtoring of Diſcipline was a hard Task. It will not be improper to relate here concerning this matter, the Opinions and the very Words of thoſe who were then imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Reformation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>They looked upon Diſcipline as a Capital Point, to reſtore Religion to its Purity. They wrote<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <p>Theſe were the Sentiments of many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the laſt Age; they ſaw that the want of Order and Diſcipline, was going to bring Libertiniſm into the Church. But yet their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96537:158"/>endeavours were not altogether uſeleſs. Some Churches drew conſiderably nearer to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Inſtitution, and there are ſome where Diſcipline is not yet quite Aboliſhed: They ſtill make uſe of ſome part of thoſe means preſcribed by the Goſpel for the Correction of Manners: They do not admit all Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to the Sacrament: They retain the uſe of Publick Penances, and even, in ſome places, of Excommunication. But yet there are ſtill many things wanting in the Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe Churches, as will appear by comparing their preſent practice with that of the Primitive Church, and with the Canons of the Ancient Diſcipline. I do not pretend that in this matter the practice of the firſt Chriſtians ought to be copied in every thing, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in many points we ought to conform to it.</p>
                  <p>If we examine in what manner Diſcipline is adminiſtred now a days, we may obſerve ſeveral Defects in it which are pretty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For inſtance we ſhall find, Churches where Excommunication is uſed about Matters of no great importance; where that which is called Excommunication, is rather a civil Sentence or Puniſhment, than an Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, and where, not the Paſtors of the Church, but civil Judges Excommunicate. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common Fault is, that Diſcipline is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed only upon two or three ſorts of Sinners; Fornicators and Notorious Blaſphemers are indeed ſeverely proceeded againſt, but a great many perſons are ſuffered in the Church, who
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96537:159"/>have nothing of Chriſtianity in their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſuch as Drunkards, idle People and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Sinners; whom the divine Laws ſubject as much to the rigor of Diſcipline, as Adulterers. It would be altogether Neceſſary to uſe Diſcipline againſt thoſe who enter into Marriage only to conceal their ſhame, and yet in moſt Churches no ſatisfaction is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſuch People: This is a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great moment. There is no ſufficient care taken, to be ſatisfied about the Sincerity of Sinners Repentance, when they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the peace of the Church. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Precept about avoiding all familiar intercourſe with Scandalous Sinners, is out of uſe. By all this we may ſee, that few Churches can boaſt a pure Diſcipline. But ſuppoſing that true Diſcipline might be found in ſome places, yet how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects do creep into the beſt conſtituted Churches, either through the ſtubborneſs of Sinners, the oppoſition of corrupt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or through the fault and careleſneſs of Paſtors? The beſt Laws are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when they are not obſerved, ſo that whether thoſe, who ought to exerciſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline for the giving a ſtop to Scandals, do it not; or whether they have not the power to do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſtill true that Corruption proceeds from the want of Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>What muſt we ſay then of thoſe Churches, where Diſcipline is wholly unknown? where neither Church nor Paſtors have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96537:159"/>to govern or inſpect, where Miniſters dare not exclude any one from the Sacrament, but admit all Perſons indifferently to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion; which Abuſe would have been thought an unheard of Profanation in the Primitive Church; and where all publick Penances are out of Doors? I ſay nothing of Excommunication; if any Man ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the reſtoring of it, his deſign would be looked upon in many places as an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crime: And the ſtrangeſt thing of all, is, that this want of Diſcipline, is to be found in Churches, which acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the rule of Religion; and that there are Divines, who inſtead of promoting the re-eſtabliſhment of Diſcipline, oppoſe it, and maintain that none are to be debarred from the Sacrament; who cannot endure the very Name of Excommunication, and who pretend that where the Magiſtrate puniſhes Vice, there is no need of any other Diſcipline. Thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have not the greater number on their ſide, but their Opinion prevails, becauſe it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours Policy and Licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>We are to impute to this fatal remiſneſs, the looſneſs and irregularity of the Manners Chriſtians. I need not inſiſt more upon this, for every one is ſenſible of it. Good Order keeps Men in Duty, but where there is no Order, Vice muſt of neceſſity bear ſway. What ſhould reſtrain People? Excepting ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Admonitions which are delivered in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons every Perſon is left to himſelf, and lives

Thoſe who lead the moſt Un-chriſtian Life, Sweaters, Covetous, Profane, Lewd and Intemperate Perſons, all ſorts of People, live peaceably in the Church, they are reputed Members of it, they are mingled among true Chriſtians, they enjoy with them the ſame Spiritual Priviledges, at leaſt in all outward appearance, and they are admitted to the ſame Sacraments. As long as things are in this ſtate; we muſt not hope to ſee any abatement of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>But that nothing may be omitted which may contribute to the clearing of this matter, it is neceſſary to anſwer ſome Objections,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> and that which is alledged to excuſe, or even to juſtifie the taking away of the Ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Againſt the reſtoring of Diſcipline, ſome ſay, (which was objected in the laſt Age) <hi>that it is ſufficient for the Edification of the Church; that the Goſpel ſhould be Preached in it, ſince that is the ordinary mean which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to procure the Converſion and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men.</hi> The Goſpel no doubt is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to teach us all that is neceſſary to be known in Religion; but it is not true, that God makes uſe only of the Preaching of the Goſpel, for the Salvation of Men: For he uſes other Means beſides, as for inſtance the Sacraments; and thoſe means, among which Diſcipline is to be reckoned, are preſcribed by
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96537:161"/>the Goſpel it ſelf, ſo that whoſoever ſubmits to the Goſpel, muſt likewiſe ſubmit to that Order we ſpeak of. But further, the Goſpel barely Preached and known is not ſufficient to Salvation; nothing but the practice of the Goſpel can ſave a Man, and it is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Preach it, if the Manners of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not regulated, and if Diſcipline is not uſed to that end, as a Mean appointed of God. As to Preaching it will be ſhewen in the next Chapter, that Men aſcribe more efficacy to it than it has, and that there is a miſtake in the Opinion which they commonly entertain of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe who are for Myſtical Devotion and Piety will certainly ſay, <hi>That Diſcipline is not eſſential to Religion, that it is a matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Order, and that external things are uſeful only to carnal and imperfect Chriſtians.</hi> But I deſire thoſe who have ſuch Opinions, to ſpeak more reverently of an Order of which God is the Author, and which the Apoſtles have ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly recommended. It cannot be thought that the Apoſtles, who did aboliſh the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ceremonies, would at the ſame time have burdened the Church with needleſs Laws, or that they would have interpoſed Chriſt's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the obſervation of an Order, which had not been neceſſary. They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to conſider beſides, that Men have Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as well as Souls, that among a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>le there are many Perſons of a groſs Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who cannot be reſtrained but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96537:162"/>by external Laws, and that it is abſurd to pretend, that Men can be ſo Spiritualized, as to need no longer outward Aids to Piety. But it is a groſs Error to look upon Diſcipline, as an Order purely external: For properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is an Order altogether Spiritual. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline does not touch either Men's Bodies or their Eſtates, it uſes only Spiritual means, and it is efficacious no farther, than as it operates upon the Heart and Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But others will caſt the Objection I have now Confuted into this form, they will ſay, <hi>That in external things, among which Diſcipline is to be ranked, Churches are at liberty to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late themſelves as they think good.</hi> I grant that Churches have that Liberty in indifferent things, which are not appointed by a Divine Authority, but this cannot be applied to the Matter in hand. An Eſtabliſhment of Divine Inſtitution cannot be reckoned among things indifferent. Do we look upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as indifferent Ceremonies, which we are not bound to obſerve, under pretence that they are but External Rites and Ordinances? Churches indeed have a Liberty where there is no Law, tho' ſtill that Liberty is to be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſcreetly uſed, for fear of Confuſion; but when God has ſettled an Order, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not at liberty to chuſe another, to make new Laws and to ſet up a new Form of Government. Such a Liberty would be mere Unrulineſs, and a criminal and ſac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Preſumption. This would be the way
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96537:162"/>to multiply Sects and Religions infinitely.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſame Anſwer may ſerve to Refute thoſe, who to juſtify the Practice of thoſe Churches, which do not obſerve the form of Diſcipline uſed in the Primitive. Church, make a diſtinction between Diſcipline and the manner of exerciſing it. They own <hi>that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is neceſſary, and that there ought to be Order in the Church; but they think that the way of exerciſing Diſcipline may vary, according to Time, Place, and other Circumſtances.</hi> This Diſtinction may be received, when the Caſe is only about ſome indifferent Circumſtances, but it is alledged without Reaſon when the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerning the ſubſtance or the Eſſence of the thing it ſelf. The Diſorder we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, is, that what is eſſential in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline has been taken away, to ſubſtitute in lieu of it, another Order, and to ſet up a new Diſcipline of which the Apoſtles did not ſpeak a word. Now that which is moſt eſſential in Diſcipline, and which is not obſerved in moſt Churches, is this, That Scandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not to be ſuffered in the Church; and yet they are ſuffered: That they are to be warned and reproved in private, and even in publick; this is ſeldom done, and in ſome Places it is never done: That Chriſtians ought to ſeparate themſelves from thoſe who live diſorderly; and this is not obſerved: That upon certain occaſions, they are to be cut off from the Body of the Faithful; but Paſtors dare not ſo much as mention this: That the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96537:163"/>Adminiſtration of Diſcipline belongs to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, that they ought to preſide, proceed and judge in all emergent Caſes; the Scripture gives them that Right, and aſcribes to them thoſe Offices; but they have been deveſted of them, new Political Bodies have been Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which there is but one Church-man, or two for form's ſake, who often have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Vote nor Authority in them. It is of Divine Right that Sinners ſhould give real Proofs of their Repentance, as for Inſtance, by making Reſtitution, by Reconciliations, by acknowledging their Fault; but this is not now required of them; nay, in ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it is not ſo much as enquired into. It is againſt all the Laws of Diſcipline, that none ſhould be excluded from the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet in moſt Places this is not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Laſtly, it is an Apoſtolical Order and Practice, That Sinners ſhould not be received to the Peace of the Church, but after they have fitted themſelves for it, by a ſincere, and if the Caſe requires, by a publick Repentance; but now a-days thoſe ancient Rules of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline are aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>After all this, can it be ſaid that no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has happen'd in the eſſence of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but only in the manner of it? Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Suſpenſions, Excommunication, and the Authority of Paſtors are taken away, the Government appointed by the Scripture is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned, another and quite different Form is brought into the room of it; and yet Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96537:163"/>will ſay, that the Queſtion is not about the thing it ſelf, but the manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not ſufficient to have any kind of Order; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God has preſcribed, and no other, ought to be obſerved. Some Circumſtances may be varied according to the neceſſities of Churches, but the ſubſtance of the thing it ſelf is unalterable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Many are of Opinion, that the Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magiſtrate ſupplies that want of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and that this way is by much preferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the other. I confeſs, that the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by the Magiſtrate upon Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Livers are of great uſe; that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates who uſe their Authority to ſuppreſs Vice are very commendable, and that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is of much greater force, when it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Authority of Civil Powers. But ſtill the Divine Inſtitution is to be preſerved intire; it does neither belong to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor to any Power to alter that which God has Commanded, and to deprive the Church of her Right. After all, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Magiſtrate is not the Diſcipline of the Church; theſe are two diſtinct things and of a quite different Nature. The Magiſtrate uſes external and corporal Puniſhments; Fines, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, Force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Methods are certainly uſeful, they may terrify Sinners, and in ſome reſpects keep them in Awe and Duty: But beſides this, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to work upon the Heart, and to bind the Conſcience by thoſe Methods which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96537:164"/>uſes, or elſe it is to be feared, that we ſhall only make Hypocrites, and that Men will abſtain from Evil more out of the fear of Puniſhment, and upon temporal Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than from motives of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Nay there are People, who if they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear but a Fine, or ſome Days Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, would gladly purchaſe at that rate the liberty of ſinning, and fancy that, provided, ſatisfaction be made to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, there is no more to be done for the clearing of their Conſcience. Beſides, what an diſorderly thing is it, that an Offender who is proſecuted, fined, and impriſoned by the Magiſtrate, ſhould ſtill be treated like a Member of the Church, and admitted to the Holy Sacrament? The Magiſtrate's Authority is therefore a very efficacious Mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Glory of God, when it is joined with Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; but to think that Civil Laws are ſufficient to Regulate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and to reclaim Sinners, is a Conceit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as unreaſonable, as it would be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to proceed againſt Robbers, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſturbers of the publick Peace, only by Spiritual Puniſhments. Let no Man then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoſe things which God has ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is farther ſaid, <hi>That theſe Rules of Diſcipline were only for a time, and that the times are altered.</hi> But how can it be proved, that the Laws of Diſcipline were made only for a time? Is there any ground for this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96537:164"/>in the Scripture, or in the Nature of thoſe Laws? Are the Laws of Diſcipline like thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which do no longer bind us? Did the Apoſtles make this diſtinction? Did St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay upon this Subject as he did in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſe,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor.</note> 
                     <hi>I only give my judgement; I have no Commandment of the Lord?</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Does he not ſpeak poſitively of the Order according to which the Church is to be Governed? Does he not Command in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt? Does he not eſtabliſh general Laws and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims for all the Churches? The Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed appointed ſome Rules, the obſervation of which is not neceſſary at this Day, becauſe thoſe Regulations were viſibly founded upon particular Reaſons, which do no longer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and therefore they are not propoſed as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Laws. But the Reaſons upon which Diſcipline is founded, and which are taken from Order and Edification, from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church, from the Converſion of Sinners, and from the Nature of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, thoſe Reaſons do ſtill ſubſiſt, and conſequently the Rules of Diſcipline are Sacred and Inviolable, eſpecially being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by way of Command, and repeated in ſo many Places. The Chriſtian Church is to be Diffuſed all the World over, ſometimes She is Perſecuted, and ſometimes She enjoys a Calm, but whatever State She may be in, her Nature does not alter. As there is but one God, one Church, one Faith, one Baptiſm; ſo there is to be but One Order, at leaſt as to Eſſential.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96537:165"/>Things, and that Order ought to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws of the Apoſtles. Or elſe there will be, as in fact we ſee there are as many different Cuſtoms and Diſciplines, as there are Kingdomes, States, Provinces, nay, Towns and Churches.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is commonly objected; <hi>That the Zeal of the Primitive Chriſtians is extinct, that Men are now very Corrupt, and that it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring them to a ſubmiſſion to the Diſcipline of the Church.</hi> But that very thing that Men are corrupt proves the Neceſſity of Diſcipline. Order is never more neceſſary, than when all is in Confuſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. I. 9.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>that the Law is not made for a righteous Man, but for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Diſobedient.</hi> Diſcipline ſeems more neceſſary now, than it was in the firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe then Perſecution kept Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Church, but when the Church is in peace, Vices and Scandals do infallibly multiply; and then it is, that good Diſcipline is of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>But then it is ſaid, <hi>that it would be impoſſible to reſtore it, conſidering the Diſpoſition Men are now in.</hi> I confeſs this deſign would meet with oppoſition. Thoſe who go about to reſtore Order and ſuppreſs Licentiouſneſs, muſt ſtill encounter difficulties; but yet this might be compaſſed if Princes and Magiſtrates did not oppoſe it. If all the Paſtors did ſet about it with a Zeal accompanied with Prudence and Gentleneſs, if they did carefully inſtruct the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96537:165"/>People concerning the neceſſity of Diſcipline, and if they did apply themſelves to the civil Powers with equal Vigour and Reſpect, they would carry the point at Laſt. After all, the People are not in a worſe diſpoſition than the Heathens were in, before the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to them; and there are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and Magiſtrates who have Piety and Zeal. If then the Heathens of old could be brought under the Diſcipline of Chriſt, in the ſight of Heathen Magiſtrates, ſhould we deſpair of ſubjecting Chriſtians to it? The inſtance of thoſe Churches where Diſcipline is obſerved, at leaſt in part, and where Excommunication and publick Penances are in uſe, ſhews that there is no impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſucceed in this deſign. If the thing was impoſſible, God would never have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the laſt place here is an Objection which is commonly urged with great force, and which ſeems to have much weight in it. It is ſaid, <hi>that we have reaſon to fear that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline would bring Tyranny into the Church, and that thoſe who govern it, would then aſſume too much Authority.</hi> Let us ſee whether this Fear is well grounded.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, if we ſuppoſe this Principle, that Diſcipline is inſtituted of God, and that the Apoſtles did commit it to the Church and her Governours, which I think has been fully demonſtrated, will it not be a kind of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, to ſay; that Diſcipline is not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96537:166"/>leſt Paſtors ſhould become Tyrants? Would not this reflect upon our Saviour and his Apoſtles, as if they had eſtabliſhed a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Order, which is apt to introduce Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? At this rate the Apoſtles and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, did incroach upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People, and the Authority of Princes. Every Chriſtian will abhor this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and yet it reſults naturally from the opinion of thoſe who reject Diſcipline for fear of Tyranny. Beſides, ſuppoſing that Chriſt has inſtituted the Order we ſpeak of, can we thus argue againſt it, without ſhaking off his Yoke? But Men do not conſider this. They fancy that every thing that is granted to the Church is granted to her Governors, whereas they ſhould remember that it is paid or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, whoſe Right it is, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deſpoiled of it, without Sacrilege. Here we might retort the Charge upon thoſe who bring it. They talk of Tyranny, and is it not an intolerable piece of Tyranny, to oppoſe a Divine Law, and to debar the Church and her Governors of the enjoyment of thoſe Rights, which God had given them?</p>
                  <p>But to come cloſer to the Objection. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be feared but one of theſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; either an Empire over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, or ſome Prejudice to the Publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and to the Authority of civil Powers.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe two Inconveniences, there is no great reaſon to fear it; ſince the Apoſtles, who ſo expreſly recommend Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96537:166"/>to Paſtors, forbid them at the ſame time to aſſume a Dominion over Conſciences. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Diſcipline is uſed only in thoſe caſes, and in that Manner which the Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and as it was practiſed by the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. V. 2. 2 Cor I. 14.</note> nothing like this is to be feared from it. The Diſcipline we ſpeak of, does not meddle with Points of Faith and ſo Fear in this reſpect is groundleſs. As to thoſe Caſes which concern Manners, Injuſtice can hardly be committed about them. The Church does not Judge of ſecret and unknown Facts. She only proceeds againſt Notoriouſly Scandalous and Impenitent Sinners, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, as ſoon as they expreſs their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; And is there any thing of Tyranny or danger in this? It is proper to obſerve here eſpecially with reference to Excommunication, which is thought the ſevereſt part of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that when the Church proceeds to that extremity, ſhe does not, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, act by way of Authority, as if ſhe had an abſolute power to puniſh a Sinner and to cut him off from her Body: But that Sinner has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by his Life cut himſelf off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſt, he is no longer a Member of the Church, ſo that the Church only declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s that, which is done and determined already, tho' ſhe ſhould not declare it.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any Cauſe to fear that the Publick Peace ſhould be diſturbed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Diſcipline. On the contrary, Society
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96537:167"/>will be the better Regulated for it. For Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline does not touch Civil Matters. Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication it ſelf, does not hinder a Man from being ſtill a Member of the Common-wealth, nor that all the Duties of Juſtice and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould be diſcharged towards him.</p>
                  <p>As for the Authority of Civil Powers, it is no ways injured by this, as evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the firſt Chriſtians exerciſing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline openly in the fight of the Heathen Magiſtrates, without any oppoſition from them. Chriſt did not come into the World to Erect a Temporal Kingdom, nor to draw Men off from their Submiſſion to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kings and Magiſtrates. It is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a true Chriſtian,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat XXII.</note> 
                     <hi>To render unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſar's, and to God the things which are God's.</hi> This Principle will not deceive a Man, and as long as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it, all things will be in order. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſo far from giving any juſt umbrage to Princes, that on the contrary it ſtrengthens their Authority. Submiſſion to the higher Powers is recommended by the Apoſtle in the moſt earneſt manner. The Chriſtians of the firſt Ages, who were very ſtrict obſervers of Diſcipline, diſtinguiſhed themſelvs by their Loyalty to Princes. Nay, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that their Diſcipline which was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt Sinners, was as ſtrict againſt thoſe who were wanting in the Fidelity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to Superiors, witneſs that Cannon,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96537:167"/>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Can. Apoſt. 84.</note> which enjoins the Depoſition of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy-men, who ſhould offer an Affront to the Prince or his Officers.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever will take the pains to weigh this Matter, will acknowledge that Diſcipline is a diſtinct thing from the Civil Power. Each of theſe has its bounds and limits. The Church does not touch the Body nor Civil Matters, and it is not the Magiſtrate's buſineſs, to regulate things relating to Conſcience and Salvation. Indeed if Magiſtrats imagine, that they have a right to Govern the Church as they think fit, and that they hold the ſame Rank in it, which they hold in the Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſo that the Miniſters of Religion are but their Officers; Diſcipline may ſeem to them to leſſen their Authority: But let thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch thoughts, ſee how they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them with the Goſpel, and with the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this it will be ſaid, that Church-men have been known to uſurp a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Conſciences and over Kings. It is true, Church-men have abuſed their Authority, but becauſe a thing has been abuſed, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be aboliſhed? Wiſe Men will rather ſay, that things ought to be reſtored to their natural State and to their lawful Uſe. Elſe the whole Authority of Kings and Magiſtrates might be pulled down, and we might argue thus. Monarchical Governments liable to great Inconveniences, Kings have been Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96537:168"/>and Uſurpers, therefore there muſt be no more Kings. Magiſtrates and Judges have been unjuſt, Covetous, Cruel, and therefore no Magiſtrates are to be endured. Would not this Argument be extravagant and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And yet the like Argument is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Diſcipline. In Church as well as in State Government, there will be always ſome inconveniency to be feared; this Evil is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unavoidable, there being no Form of Government which the Malice of Men may not abuſe: But thoſe Abuſes are without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a leſs Evil than Anarchy, which is the moſt dangerous State of all.</p>
                  <p>But let us clear the Matter of Fact, upon which the Objection I am now Confuting, is founded: It is ſuppoſed, that Diſcipline did introduce Tyranny; but on the contrary, it was upon the Ruins of Diſcipline, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny was erected. This is known to all thoſe, who have any knowledge of Antiquity. When did Biſhop and Clergy-men uſurp that exceſſive Authority, over mens Eſtates, Perſons &amp; Conſciences? It was when the Obſervation of the Ancient Diſcipline was ſlackned, when Diſcipline began to wear out of uſe, when Sinners, and eſpecially great Men, were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Money, when that which ſhould have been tranſacted by the whole Church, was referred only to the Clergy, and when publick Confeſſion was changed into a private one. It was by theſe means, and not by the due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Diſcipline, that Church-men made themſelves Maſters of all.</p>

                  <p>What we ought to do then is this, Firſt, to enquire what is of Divine Inſtitution in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and to reſtore that; in the next place to conſider what the Salvation of Sinners and the Honour of the Church require, and what was good and edifying in the practice of the Primitive Church, in order to conform to it; and laſtly, to provide by good Laws, that no Man may exceed the bounds of his Calling; particularly, that in reſtoring to the Clergy their lawful Authority, all juſt meaſure may be taken, to prevent their abuſing it. If Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes are bound to preſerve the Rights of the Church, they ought likewiſe to take care that nothing be done againſt their own Authority, and to puniſh thoſe who oppoſe it, or who diſturb the Civil Society, whether Eccleſiaſticks or Lay-men. This we are to treat of in another place.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, when we ſpeak for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcipline, we mean that Paſtors, ſhould be ſubjected to it as well as their Flocks, and that if there is an Order in the Church to regulate the Manners of Chriſtians, there ſhould be one alſo to regulate the Clergy, and to lay ſtrict Obligations on them to diſcharge their Duty in all its parts; And that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ancient Practice, Diſcipline ought to be more ſevere, againſt the Eccleſiaſticks who fail in their Office, than againſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But as we have complained in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the want of Diſcipline, with Relation to the Church in general, ſo we are going to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96537:169"/>ſhew in the next, that this want is neither leſs obſervable, nor leſs fatal, in thoſe things, which concern the Governors of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with ſaying that in Order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the Corruption of Manners among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it is abſolutely Neceſſary to reſtore the uſe of Diſcipline. This is what has been and is ſtill heartily wiſhed for, by many Perſons of eminent Learning and Piety, and it is that which I deſire all thoſe who have a Zeal for the Glory of God, to take into their ſerious Conſideration.</p>

                  <head>CAUSE III. The Defects of the Clergy.</head>
                  <p>IN ſearching after the Cauſes of the Decay of Piety, we cannot but enquire, whether Corruption does not proceed from the Paſtors and Governors of the Church. Paſtors are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to oppoſe the Progreſs of Vice, and to be publick Fountains of Inſtruction, Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and good Example; ſo that in truth their Miniſtry is of moſt excellent uſe, when duly exerciſed. But when Vice reigns, when Scandals multiply; that general Corruption is, if not a certain Proof, at leaſt a ſtrong Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that there is ſome fault in Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>If we would be ſatisfied about this matter, we need but reflect upon the Nature of their
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96537:169"/>Office, and upon their way of diſcharging it. This is what I deſign to enquire into in this Chapter: In order to which, I ſhall conſider. 1. What Functions and Duties are annexed to the Office of Paſtors, And 2. What Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are requiſite in them to diſcharge it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> There are two principal Functions incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on Paſtors: Inſtruction and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It would be needleſs to prove that the Office of Paſtors obliges them to inſtruct the People and to preach the Goſpel, for this is beyond all Queſtion. It will be fitter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the fruit of publick Inſtructions delivered in Sermons, depends upon two things; the Matters treated of, and the Way of propoſing them; ſo that the Faults commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Sermons are either in the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in the Manner of handling them</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Matters handled in Sermons, are either of Doctrine or Morality. What has been ſaid in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, may ſerve to diſcover to us the Defects in Preaching, with relation to theſe two Heads. Thoſe who preach the Goſpel do not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtruct the People, neither in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines, nor in the Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And as Catechiſing is properly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the explication of theſe Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I think Ignorance and Corruption chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from this, that in moſt Churches, things are not well ordered, with reference to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96537:170"/>Catechiſing. They are neither frequent enough, nor ſo proper for Inſtruction as they ſhould be. Beſides, Catechiſing is almoſt every where neglected, if not deſpiſed. The common Notion is, that Catechiſms are only for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and for the meaner ſort of People. The Function of a Catechiſt, which was anciently ſo conſiderable in the Church, is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now as a Function of no great importance, and it is uſually committed to Perſons of the leaſt Knowledge and Experience.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Faults might eaſily be remedied. One of the moſt uſeful Eſtabliſhments in Churches, would be to encreaſe the Number of Catechiſms, and to appoint them inſtead of the Sermon. But to render them more uſeful and more frequented, it would be neceſſary to eſtabliſh two ſorts of them. In thoſe of the firſt ſorts the Elements of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be explained in an eaſy and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, for the benefit of Children and of the leſs-knowing part of Chriſtians. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be for thoſe who have attained a higher degree of Knowledge, and in theſe, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that had been propoſed but generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould be more fully and exactly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But if it be thought that an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Nature, and that the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Catechiſings, might meet with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Obſtructions, it would be neceſſary at leaſt, for the inſtruction of great numbers of Perſons, who never aſſiſt at thoſe Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that Miniſters ſhould he obliged to preach
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96537:170"/>upon the ſame Subjects, which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated in Catechiſms.</p>
                  <p>As for Sermons, the Church would reap more benefit from them, if Preachers did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhew true Judgment in the choiſe of the Matters they handle. We muſt not think that all ſorts of Subjects are inſtructive alike, and that in order to Preach the Goſpel, it is enough to ſpeak of God in a Sermon, and to take a Text out of Scripture. Every Subject ought to be propoſed and preſſed according to its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To inſiſt upon Matters of leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt thoſe which it moſt concerns Chriſtians to be Informed about are neglected, is to ſwerve from the true intendment of Preaching. But becauſe all Preachers have not the Capacity to make this Choice, it would be fitting, that part of the Matter of their Diſcourſes, ſhould be appointed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them by a Law. For when they are tyed to no Rule, when they are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Preach upon any Subject, which they think fit to chuſe, it happens that many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of handling the moſt important things in Religion, and of conſulting the preſent State and Neceſſities of their Flocks, apply themſelves to various Subjects which are of no great Edification.</p>
                  <p>Preachers for the moſt part, conſult only their own Inclination in the choice of their Matter; and when they pitch upon a Subject, it is rather becauſe it pleaſes them, and becauſe they apprehend a facility in treating it, than
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96537:171"/>out of a regard to the neceſſities of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Thoſe who are fond of Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Allegories, apply their time and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Expounding of the Prophecies, and to the unfolding of the Types of the Old Teſtament. Thoſe who are given to Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, fill their Sermons with nothing elſe but Controverſy. And the ſame may be ſaid of Speculative Divines, who are converſant in the Fathers and Hiſtory, they entertain the People with thoſe things which are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Subject of their Meditations and Studies. I do not mean, that ſuch things ought never to be ſpoken of; they may ſometimes be touched upon, provided, this be done judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly: But they have a ſorry Notion of Religion and Preaching, who make thoſe Matters their main Buſineſs, and fancy they have entirely fulfilled all the parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Miniſtry, when they have Preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Types, or Controverſy.</p>
                  <p>What I have now ſaid, may be applied to the choice of Texts.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. III. 16.</note> All Scripture indeed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, is profitable for Inſtruction; that Divine Book contains nothing but what is uſeful; but yet the various uſefulneſs of the ſeveral parts of Scripture, is to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and it muſt be owned that ſome Places are more uſeful and inſtructive than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Some difference is to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Books and Chapters, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Doctrine of Redemption, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96537:171"/>of Chriſt's coming into the World, or the Duties of a Chriſtian Life; and thoſe which ſerve only to acquaint us with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Times, and to confirm the certainty of Hiſtory. Theſe laſt have their uſe, ſince the Truth of Hiſtory is one of the main Proofs of the Truth of Religion; but thoſe Places are more uſeful which Treat of what we are to believe or to do in order to Salvation. It is of another ſort of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Explain the Goſpel, than to Preach upon the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Ruth,</hi> or upon ſome Places of the Prophets. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that ſome have thought, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is equally Rich every where; that all Doctrines may be drawn from all Texts; that thoſe Chapters and Verſes which ſeem the moſt barren, and where there appears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, contain Myſteries and Treaſures which might exhauſt even the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of Angels; but this Conceit is ſo abſurd and repugnant to Senſe, that I do not think it worth my while to Confute it.</p>
                  <p>Morals being ſo Eſſential a part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be very particularly inſiſted upon by Preachers, and yet few do it; ſo that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of all things is that which is the moſt ſuperficially handled in the greateſt part of Sermons. This Fault in Preachers proceeds from ſeveral Cauſes. Some have a Prejudice againſt Morality, and think it ought not to be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>Others who are conceited with vain Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96537:172"/>imagine that to Preach Morals, argues but an ordinary meaſure of Parts, and little skill in Divinity, and that it becomes them better to ſoar after high Speculations, and to dive into the Myſteries of Faith and of the moſt ſublime Theology. This Cuſtom of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting more upon Doctrine than Morals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds alſo from another Cauſe, which is, that in this laſt Age Divines were fain to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Explaining and Diſputing; and ſo the ſame Method has been followed ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>I am apt to think beſides, that many Divines neglect Morality, becauſe the treating of it is more difficult, than the explaining Doctrinal Matters. Let thoſe ſupercilious and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Divines ſay what they will, the right handling of Morality is the hardeſt thing in Preaching. It is eaſie to explain a Text, or a point of Doctrine; and a Man muſt be very meanly gifted, if with the help of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or a Commons-Place, he is not able to do the feat, and to furniſh out his hour. But to Preach Morals is quite another thing. I confeſs that there is a way of Preaching Morality which requires no great pains. If Men content themſelves with delivering Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sayings concerning Vice and Virtue, this may be done without much labour. But when a Preacher purſues true Morality, when he is to maſter the Hearts of Men, to reform the Manners of a whole Congregation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Inclinations of his Hearers, and to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96537:172"/>make them renounce their Paſſions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; then it is that he meets with many and great difficulties; this is an inexhauſtible Spring of Labour and Mediation, and a task which few Preachers care <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> take upon them.</p>
                  <p>In Religion, Doctrine ſhould never be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Morality, nor one of theſe preferred before the other. But yet it is neceſſary to inſiſt more upon Morality than upon Doctrine, not only becauſe the deſign of our whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to make us good Men, but alſo becauſe Morality cannot effectually be taught, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being much dwelt upon. It is only by enlarging on matters, and entring into many Particulars, that the two ends of Morality are to be attained, which are inſtructing Men in their Duty, and perſuading them to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it.</p>
                  <p>Morality is of a vaſt extent, as may appear by conſidering how many Duties are compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under theſe three Heads of Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Piety, Juſtice, and Temperance. Beſides theſe Duties which are common to all Men, there are ſome Particular ones relating to the different Conditions, Callings, Ages, and States which Men are in. And how many things are there to be conſidered upon all theſe Heads? This is not all, for theſe Duties vary infinitely, by reaſon of the diverſity of Circumſtances. There are almoſt as many different Diſpoſitions as there are Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a great Multitude of Men who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96537:173"/>to the ſame Vice; there are hardly two who are vicious in the ſame degree and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is therefore requiſite that Preachers ſhould deſcend into particulars, and that they ſhould ſo characterize Duties, Vertues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that every one may know himſelf in the Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>And yet this relates only to bare Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now if in the next place we intend to engage Men to the Practice of theſe Duties, there new Difficulties will ariſe, and no good Succeſs can be expected but from aſſiduous Care and conſtant Labour. There are in Man's Heart, ſo many different Diſpoſitions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo many Illuſions and Prejudices, ſo many Windings and Artifices, that a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application is required for us to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate our ſelves into it. When the Truths and Doctrines of Religion are to be Taught, things need not be ſo minutely handled, and there is no occaſion to uſe ſuch mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; nay, the being very particular may be a fault. He that would Inſtruct, ſo he is clear, ſhould rather be ſhort than prolix. The Hearers do eaſily apprehend the Truths which are propoſed to them, and the moſt Corrupt Men are able to diſcern Truth from Error; a Libertine will find who is in the right or in the wrong, in a Diſpute. But it is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a thing to touch the Heart, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer inveterate Habits. What <hi>Tully</hi> ſays in his Dialogue of the Orator, deſerves to be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96537:173"/>inſerted here, it is this,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Quare qui aut breviter, aut ſummiſſe dicunt, docere judicem poſſunt, commovere non poſſunt.</note> 
                     <hi>Paſſions are not to be excited in a moment, as a Proof does preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuade ſo ſoon as it is propoſed. A Proof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Reaſons, and Reaſons clearly ſet out, make an impreſſion immediately; but when we intend to raiſe the Paſſions, the ſucceſs does not ſo much depend upon the Conviction, as upon the Perturbation of the Mind; Oratory cannot have its effect then, without Prolixity, Variety, Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Vehemence of Diſcourſe. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who ſpeak briefly and calmly; are fit to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, but not to move.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe Reflections it appears, that the Method of thoſe Preachers, who are large upon the Explication of Doctrines, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct upon Morals, is directly contrary to the true way of Preaching, and that thoſe do very ill underſtand what Morality is, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſe it, or look upon it, as the eaſieſt thing in Preaching.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe apprehend from what has been ſaid, what are the moſt ordinary Faults of Preachers when they Treat of Morals. I ſhall obſerve Three of them. Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is too general, it is defective, and it is ſometimes falſe.</p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:96537:174"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Many Preachers are too general in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling Morality. This is the Head which is the moſt ſlightly touched upon. They ſpend the greater part of their Sermons in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Senſe of a Text, they ſift all the words, and examine all the Circumſtances of it, with the utmoſt Nicety. In a word, they drain the Subject. But when they come to the Application, they content themſelves with two or three general Uſes; they addreſs to their Auditory ſome looſe Exhortations to a good Life; even when they are to ſpeak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Moral Subject, they confine themſelves for the moſt part to general Conſiderations: Nothing is Particularized, or treated with the neceſſary exactneſs Now Generalities are of no great uſe in Matters of Morality. To ſay in general Terms, that Men ought to be good, and to declaim againſt Senſuality, or Covetouſneſs, is that which will convince no Man. It is not bawling or ſending Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Hell, that is likely to win upon them. If ſhould be diſtinctly ſhewn, what it is to be a good Man; Vertues and Vices ſhould be Characterized, and their various Kinds and Degrees obſerved; particular Rules ought to be given to the Hearers, they ought to be furniſhed with neceſſary Motives and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we are to Confute their Miſtakes, and to obviate their Objections and Excuſes. Till we come to this, Preaching will be attended with little Succeſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Moral Diſcourſes of Preachers are
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96537:174"/>often defective; for beſides that they handle Morality in a ſuperficial Manner, there are ſome eſſential Articles which they ſeldom or never ſpeak of, among which we may reckon Reſtitution. The Moralities of Preachers turn almoſt altogether upon Four or Five Heads, they attach only ſome of the groſſer Sins, ſuch as Blaſphemies, Uncleanneſs, and ſuch other Vices. But this is to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the firſt Elements of Piety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. True Morality goes a great deal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Piety does not only baniſh the more heinous Sins; it does beſides fill the Heart with a ſincere love of Virtue; it ſoftens and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Inclinations, it produces in a Man, Gentleneſs, Humility, Patience, Reſignation to the Will of God, Divine Love, Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity under all Events, Charity towards other Men, and a Zeal for Juſtice and Goodneſs. This is the main of Piety, this is what ſhould be inceſſantly laid before Chriſtians, to make them apprehend the Extent and Perfection of the Morals of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Moral Diſcourſes of Preachers are Falſe. 1. When they are too remiſs; 2. When they are too ſevere, And 3. When they are Contradictory. Their Morality is too remiſs, when it does not propoſe all the Duties of Holineſs in their full latitude, when it flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Sinners, or does not ſufficiently awaken their Conſciences. It is over-ſevere, when it raiſes groundleſs Scruples in Men's minds; when it repreſents as a Sin, that which is not
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96537:175"/>really ſo; or when it makes a neceſſary Duty of any thing, which may be omitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. Preachers likewiſe over-do things, in the Pictures they draw for Virtues and Vices. If they are to ſpeak of Covetouſneſs or forbidden Pleaſure, they ſtrive to make of theſe the moſt hideous Pictures they can; they paint out a Covetous or a Voluptuous Man as a Monſter, they affect the moſt lively Deſcriptions and Figures, and their Sermons are loaded with every thing that their Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afford upon the ſubject. But all this is only noiſe, and ſo much Breath ſpent in vain. Such Morality does not hinder the Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Covetous Man, from purſuing his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe, it is rather apt to harden him in it; becauſe as he does not ſee himſelf in the diſmal Picture which is made of theſe Vices, ſo he thinks himſelf free from them, or at leaſt not very guilty of them. Laſtly, Preachers do ſometimes deliver Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Morals. Having not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditated upon the Principles of Religion and Morality, they run themſelves into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; they ſay one thing in one place, and the contrary in another; they lay down Principles which deſtroy the Conſequences they will draw from them, or they draw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which over-turn the Principles they have laid down.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Faults I have hitherto obſerved, relate to the Matter of Preaching; thoſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96537:175"/>which are committed in the manner are not indeed ſo eſſential, but yet they are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant enough to deſerve ſome notice here.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpoſe to preach pure Doctrine and good Morality, if this is not done in a proper way to inſtruct and to perſwade. The moſt important Truths loſe their force in the Mouth of a Man, who either cannot ſpeak of them in a ſutable manner, or expreſses them obſcurely. And ſo likewiſe the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and cenſuring, is often the reaſon why Exhortations and Cenſures prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. Either they are not accurate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing enough, or they are Gold and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, or they are not ſeaſoned with Prudence and Mildneſs; but are a kind of Fire, which has more of Anger and Indiſcretion, than of true Zeal in it, and which offends more, than it affects or perſwades the Hearers.</p>
                  <p>Divers Conſiderations might be here inſiſted upon concerning the way of Preaching; but I think what is moſt Material to be ſaid on this Subject, may be reduced to this one thing; that the manner of Preaching is not Simple and Natural enough. The way of Preaching ſhould correſpond with the Deſign of Religion and Sermons, which is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Underſtanding, and to move the Heart. This End is attained by thoſe, who think and ſpeak clearly and naturally, when every thing, in Reaſoning, Method, Stile, and Exterior, is regulated by Nature and true Senſe. But it has been obſerved
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96537:176"/>long ago, to Preachers are particularly apt to fail in this reſpect. Falſe and confuſed Ideas, un-accurate Reaſonings, ſtrained or impertinent Reflections, forced and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſions, are almoſt become the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of that Order of Men. One would think that moſt Preachers take pains not to follow Nature; as if a Man was too ſooner in the Pulpit, but he muſt ſpeak no longer like the reſt of Mankind, as if the part of a Preacher was ſomething like that of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet among the Jews. Nay this is paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Proverb; ſo that odd Ways and injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflections, are called Ways and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Preachers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Nature was conſulted, and it men did conſider the end of Preaching, they would ſee in the firſt place, that the Method which is followed by many, in the explaining of Scripture and the compoſing of Sermons, had need be reformed in ſome reſpects, and that it does not agree ſo well as it ſhould, with the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. For inſtance, why ſhould Time be waſted in Exordiums and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries? Why ſhould a Preacher dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the explaining of Words and Phraſes which every Body underſtands, or upon preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the leaſt Circumſtances of a Text? What ſignify thoſe needleſs Digreſſions, thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which no body thinks of, thoſe cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtories, which in ſome Countries fill up Sermons, and ſo many other ſmall Niceties, which clog theſe kind of Diſcourſes.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:96537:176"/>All this might be let alone, without prejudice to publick edification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is for want of Conſulting Nature, that Preachers are obſcure. Sometimes the Obſcurity of their Sermons ariſes from the things they ſpeak of, when they are obſcure in themſelves. But at other times this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity proceeds, from their not having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ideas of the Subjects they treat. Their Stile and Language do alſo contribute much to make them dark. Some uſe Scholaſtical Words and Terms of Art, which are Arabick to the People; others delight in figurative and improper Expreſſions, which preſent falſe Ideas to the Mind. Now they might avoid all theſe Faults, if they did not forſake Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Simplicity. But ſome Preachers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſaying new and ſingular things, and they would be ſorry if they had made uſe of ſimple and common Ideas, Reaſonings and Expreſſions, which yet are the cleareſt and the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Falſe Eloquence proceeds from the ſame Source. Preachers commonly aim at Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and it is to compaſs this End, that they take ſuch pains in the compoſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of their Sermons, and that they affect a Style, a Pronunciation and Geſtures, which become a Stage-player or a Profane Orator, much better than a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. I might remark here, that this affection of Eloquence, is not very ſuitable to the Spirit of Piety, which ſhould animate a Clergy-man.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96537:177"/>but not to moralize upon this, I ſhall obſerve that theſe Preachers miſs their Mark, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo much work, and by uſing ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty endeavours to hit it. True Eloquence, the force of a Diſcourſe, an elevated and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime Style, conſiſts in following Nature. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing admits of greater vehemence and lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the Subjects which Religion affords. Let a Preacher be well accquainted with theſe, let him go about them in an eaſy and natural way, but eſpecially let him feel and be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly affected with them; and he needs not trouble himſelf about any other Helps; he will deſpiſe all the falſe ſparkling, and the vain ornaments of inſipid and boyiſh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and he will not be capable of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Gramar Schollar, or a Declaimer. All that which coſts Preachers ſo much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, flights of Wit, refined Thoughts, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Deſcriptions, polite Language, all that I ſay, is very mean. By ſuch things they may raiſe at moſt a vain Admiration, but they will never Inſtruct nor Convert a Sinner. One Dram of good Senſe is worth more than all that.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some Preachers run into another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, their way of Preaching is neglected and courſe; they think to juſtify themſelves, by ſaying, that they are ſimple and popular, that they ſpeak naturally and without Art. But they ſwerve as much from Nature as the others, and as it is a Fault to be affected, it is another to be flat, homely and barbarous: It
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96537:177"/>is as much againſt Nature, to uſe ridiculous and offenſive Geſtures, Tones and Ways, or to ſtand without Motion or Action in the Pulpit, as it is to play the Declaimer there.</p>
                  <p>I might add other Conſiderations about the manner in which the Goſpel ought to be Preached, but I ſhould engage too far in this Subject. We may judge now whether Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Corruption, do not proceed from the Defects of thoſe who Preach the Goſpel. The People have ſcarce any Notion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what they gather from Sermons. If Sermons then are not Inſtructive and Edifying, either becauſe all the Truths and Duties of Chriſtianity not are propoſed in them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ill propoſed, the People muſt of neceſſity be very much in the dark.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay one Word more concerning the Inſtruction which Paſtors owe their Flocks. Publick Inſtructions, how uſeful ſoever they may be, are not ſufficient. The Edification of the Church requires, that upon certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, Paſtors ſhould likewiſe Inſtruct in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. This neceſſity of Private Inſtructions, may be proved by the following Arguments. 1. If there be none but Publick Inſtructions and Exhortations, what Inſtruction can a great many Perſons receive, who either do not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or do not hearken to Sermons? What will become of thoſe who hear, but do not underſtand what they hear, or who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, but forget it preſently, and ſo do not practiſe it? 2. All things cannot be ſaid in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96537:178"/>Sermons, how particular ſoever they may be; yet ſtill many things remain untouched. Nay, there are Matters which a Preacher cannot bring into the Pulpit. Can he enumerate all the Caſes in which Injuſtice may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Reſtitution is to be made? Can he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify thoſe infinite Frauds which are practiſed in Mens ſeveral Callings and Trades? Can all Caſes of Conſcience, about which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers want Inſtruction, be Decided in a Sermon? Dare we inſiſt in the Pulpit upon the Head of Impurity? And may not this be one of the Reaſons why that Sin is ſo common? If Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then have no opportunity to be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Private about theſe Articles, they will be ignorant with relation to them as long as they live. 3. In order to good Inſtruction it is neceſſary, that the Teacher, and thoſe who are Taught, ſhould communicate their Thoughts to one another. For the Hearers may have their Doubts; they may ſometimes be at a ſtand, by reaſon of ſomething which they do not know, or of ſome Difficulty which ſtarts up in their Minds. Some have been hearing Sermons for theſe Twenty or thirty Years, who yet entertain Scruples and Doubts concerning the Fundamentals of Religiom. If ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons receive no other Information, they will not be moved by any thing, that is ſaid in Publick, but they will retain their Scruples to their dying Day.</p>
                  <p>All this ſhews that private Inſtruction is a part of the Paſtoral Care: And the practice of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96537:178"/>it would certainly be very uſeful, not only for the Edification of the People, but alſo to keep the Clergy from growing remiſs, and to make them more diligent in the diſcharge of their Office. For when they have nothing to do but to Preach Sermons, it is much to be feared; conſidering Men's Propenſion to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, that they will become Negligent. It is therefore an unhappineſs, that private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſhould be almoſt out of uſe, and that there ſhould be ſo little Communication about Religious Matters, between the People and their Miniſters. We have no Inſtruction remaining, but what is delivered from the Pulpit; and that would not be ſufficient, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tho' Sermons were ſuch as they ought to be. But when private Inſtructions are wanting, and when Sermons are defective beſides, it is impoſſible but that the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, being deſtitute of neceſſary Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aids, muſt live in Corruption.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Second Function of Paſtors, which ſhould perhaps be named in the firſt place, is the Conduct and Government of the Church. Upon this I obſerve. Firſt, That thoſe do not underſtand the Nature of the Paſtoral Office, who confine it to Preaching. There was a time when Preaching was quite laid aſide, and when Church-men did only perform Divine Service. But now a-days in many Churches, the whole Miniſtry is placed in the Buſineſs of Sermons, and the Eccleſiaſticks are looked upon, not as Paſtors, but Preachers; as Men
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96537:179"/>whoſe Office it is upon certain Days and Hours, to ſpeak in the Church. Preaching is is without diſpute, a part of the Office of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. But it is a great miſtake to think, that God has appointed them only to Preach; for they are entruſted beſides with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and this part of their Employment is at leaſt, as eſſential as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is remarkable, that the Scripture ſpeaks of Paſtors in divers Places, and that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles it gives them, and the Functions it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to them, relate chiefly to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. This is implyed in the Name of Biſhops, Prieſts or Elders, Guides and Paſtors: St. <hi>Paul</hi> has writ concerning the Duties of the Miniſtry, if we examine what he ſays of the Functions of that Charge, and of the Qualifications of thoſe who are to be admitted into it; we ſhall find that he is much larger upon the Government of the Church, than upon Preaching. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> may be conſulted.</p>
                  <p>But further, all Church-men are not called to Preaching. The Apoſtles diſtinguiſh their Functions; they tell us,<note n="*" place="bottom">See 1 Cor. XII. 4, 5, 6. 28, 29, 30. Act. VI. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. XII. 6, 7, 8. 1 Tim. V. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>That all are not Doctors, that all do not Interpret, that all do not adminiſter the Word, that all do not Teach and Exhort; that ſome are appointed to Inſtruct, to Exhort, and to Expound the Scriptures, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Govern, and others to do works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:96537:179"/>Tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe that there is nothing in this, which relates to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts conferred upon the firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, and to the Order which was then obſerved; yet it is plain, that theſe Places are to be underſtood, of the Gifts and Functions of ordinary Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed by the Practice of the Primitive Church. The principal and the moſt general Function of Paſtors then, was the Inſpection and Governing of the Church. Preaching was not neglected, but all Church-Men were not Preachers, this Province was committed to thoſe who were fit for it. Would to God this Diſtinction was ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved! The Church would be better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Goſpel better Preached than it is. There are Talents requiſite to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which every Body has not, and others are neceſſary for the Conduct of the Church; and all theſe Gifts ſeldom meet in one Perſon. If then no regard is had to different Gifts and Functions if without diſtinction ever thing is committed to one Perſon, it is viſible that the Church will be ill Edified. Beſides that I have ſhewed in the Firſt Chapter of this Second Part, that it is a dangerous Notion, which reſtrains the Miniſtry to Preaching But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Inconveniency it would be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that a competent Number of Eccleſiaſticks ſhould be had in every Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To expreſs my Thoughts more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning the Office of Paſtors, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96537:180"/>to the Government of the Church; I obſerve, Firſt, that Diſcipline is worn out of uſe, as I have ſhewn at large in a Chapter upon that Subject. It is true, that this Defect is not wholly to be imputed to Paſtors. If they do not Govern the Church by a good Diſcipline, it is becauſe they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Authority. Many of them are ſenſible of this Diſorder and lament it: But what can they do when they Exerciſe their Miniſtry in Placeſ where their Hands are tyed up, where they dare not refuſe the Sacrament to an Adulterer, and where they ſhould bring themſelves into great troubles, and perhaps be Depoſed, if they took upon them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Apoſtolical Diſcipline? They are forced to confine themſelves to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which when it is not backed with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, can never have that Effect which it would produce in conjunction with it. There was nothing left to Paſtors but what could not be taken from them without aboliſhing the whole Miniſtry: All that remains is only Preaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments. And yet for all that, a great part of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, may juſtly be charged with that Fault we complain of, and with that Corruption of the People which is a conſequence of it; ſince there are thoſe among them, who oppoſe the reſtoration of Diſcipline, and look upon it as an indifferent Order; and others who are placed in Churches, where ſome Form of Diſcipline is left, render the Exerciſe of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96537:180"/>either through Imprudence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Severity, or through a ſhameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs, and a cowardly Indulgence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſide the Publick, there is a Private Diſcipline, which conſiſts in Inſpecting the Lives of Private Perſons, in Viſiting Families, in Exhortations, Warnings, Reconciliations, and in all thoſe other Cares, which a Paſtor ought to take of thoſe over whom he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. For neither general Exhortations, nor publick Diſcipline can anſwer all the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of the Church. There are certain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which Paſtors neither can, nor ought to repreſs openly, and which yet ought to be remedied by them. In ſuch Caſes Private Admonitions are to be uſed. The Concern of Mens Salvation requires this, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Paſtoral Carefulneſs, to ſeek the the ſtraying Sheep, and not to let the Wicked periſh for want of Warning. But theſe are Cares to which ſome Paſtors do not ſo much as think themſelves obliged; they content themſelves with Admoniſhing Sinners from the Pulpit. There is very little Intercourſe between Paſtors and thoſe who are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Charge. Private Perſons live without being accountable for their Conduct to any Body; and except they commit the greateſt Enormities, they fancy no Man has a Right to enquire into their Actions. Nothing reaches them but Sermons, and theſe they mind as much, and as little as they pleaſe; this muſt needs produce Licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:96537:181"/>
                  <p>The viſiting of ſick and dying Perſons, is one of the moſt important Functions of the Office of Paſtors; but when it is not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with exactneſs and zeal, it contributes as much as can be imagined to the keeping up of Security. Every one muſt needs ſee, of what Conſequence this part of the Miniſtry is, if he conſiders that it is at the end of Life that we are to be judged, and that our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate depends upon the condition we dye in: And if we reflect at the ſame time upon what the Scripture tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. V. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>that we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the World to come, according to the good or evil we have done in this;</hi> we will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily apprehend, what Miniſters ought to do, when they viſit ſick and dying Perſons. Their chief buſineſs ſhould be, to diſcover what ſtate thoſe Perſons are in, that they may ſuit their Exhortations to it. Then is it that they ought to ſpeak to the Conſcience of Sinners, and to perſwade them by all poſſible Means, to examine their Lives, and the diſpoſition they are in, in reference to their Salvation. And when a Miniſter meets, as it happens too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, with ſick Perſons, who are engaged and hardned in vitious Habits, or whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may juſtly be queſtioned; it is then that he had need uſe all his Skill and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence all his Zeal and Endeavours, to ſave Souls which are in ſo great danger. Upon ſuch occaſions both the Miniſter and the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have need of Time, Leiſure and Freedom,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96537:181"/>and a haſty diſcourſe or Prayer ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>And now we may judge whether a Man diſcharges the Office of a Paſtor, who only in general exhorts dying Perſons to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelvs miſerable Sinners, and backs thoſe Exhortations with Aſſurances of the Divine Mercy through Jeſus Chriſt, or who only reads ſome Forms of Exhortations and Prayers, as the Cuſtom is in ſome places. This method is fitter to lay aſleep than to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a guilty Conſcience; and this way of ex-exerciſing the Miniſtry, overturns the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a future Judgment, and moſt of the Principles of Religion. A Miniſter ſpeaks to a ſick Perſon of the pardon of his Sins, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him to leave the World with joy, he diſcourſes to him of the Happineſs of another Life, and fills him with the moſt comfortable Hopes; And perhaps this ſick Perſon is a Man loaded with Guilt, a wretch who has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like an Atheiſt, who has committed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sins for which he has made no Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who has not practiſed Reſtitution, who never knew his Religion, and who is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impenitent. Such a Man ought to tremble, and yet ſuch Conſolations from the mouth of his Paſtor, make him think that he dies in a ſtate of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But if this way of viſiting and comforting the ſick, betrays them into ſecurity, it has the ſame effect upon the ſtanders by, who when they hear the Conſolations which are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96537:182"/>adminiſtred to Perſons, whom every body knows not to have led very Chriſtian lives; make a tacit Inference, that the ſame things will be ſaid to them, and that their Death will be happy, whatſoever their paſt Life may have been.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the want of Ability and Zeal, there are two things which hinder Paſtors from diſcharging towards dying People, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Duties to which their Office obliges them: The one is, that commonly Paſtors vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the Sick only in caſes of extremity; and the other is, that they have too little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with their Flocks, and no ſufficient Knowledge of the Lives and Conduct of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons; ſo that being ignorant of the State and Occaſions of the Sick, they cannot at the approach of Death, adminiſter to them wholeſom Counſels and Exhortations.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I think are the moſt eſſential Defects of Paſtors, both in the Inſtruction, and in the Government of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far treated of the Duties of the Paſtoral Charge; I come now to conſider thoſe Qualifications, with which Paſtors ought to be endued. And theſe are of two ſorts: Firſt, The Endowments of the Mind, by which I mean thoſe Abilities and Talents, which are neceſſary for the Inſtruction and Conduct of the Church; and Secondly, the Qualifications of the Heart, by which I mean Probity and Integrity of Life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Man queſtions but that Abilities and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96537:182"/>Talents are requiſite in thoſe who exerciſe the Office of Miniſters in the Church. Firſt, Some are neceſſary for Preaching the Goſpel, and for the right expounding of Scripture. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requires a greater extent of Knowledge, than is commonly imagined. To Preach well, a Man ſhould be well skilled in Languages, Hiſtory, Divinity and Morality. He ſhould be acquainted with Man's Heart, he ſhould be of a Sagacious and diſcerning Spirit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things he ſhould have a true and exact Judgment; to ſay nothing of ſome other Qualifications, which are neceſſary to every Man who ſpeaks in Publick.</p>
                  <p>Neither are theſe Endowments ſufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particular Talents are requiſite for the Conduct of the Church. To guide a Flock and to be accountable for the Salvation of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Souls, is no ſmall Charge, nor an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment which every body is fit for. A Man to whom the Government of a Church is committed, in whoſe Hands the Exerciſe of Diſcipline is lodged, whoſe Duty it is both to Exhort and Reprove both in publick and in private, and who ought to ſupply all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of a Flock, and to be provided for all Emergencies; ſuch a Man has need of a great deal of Knowledge, Zeal and Firmneſs, as well as of much Wiſdom and Prudence, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Charity. That all theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are requiſite in a Paſtor, is evident from the Nature of his Office; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches it, when he appoints that none ſhall
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96537:183"/>be admitted to this Employment, but thoſe in whom they are to be found.</p>
                  <p>What Effect then can the Miniſtry have, when it is Exerciſed by Men who want theſe Qualifications, or perhaps have the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; who are ignorant, who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Matters of Diſcipline and Morality, who can give no account of a great many things contained in Scripture, and whoſe whole Learning is confined to a Commentary; who can neither reaſon true, nor ſpeak clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; who are either Indiſcreet, Negligent or Remiſs in the Exerciſe of their Office? But I do not wonder, that theſe Qualifications are wanting in moſt Clergy-men. Vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who were not cut out for this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aſpire to it. And beſides theſe Abilities are not to be acquired without Labour and Application. Now many Church-men are ſhamefully idle; they look upon their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as a mean to live eaſy, ſo that declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duties of their Place, they content themſelves with the Incomes of it. Thoſe who are to Preach are more employed; but their Sermons are almoſt their whole Buſineſs: Their Work conſiſts for the moſt part in copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Commentaries, and as ſoon as they have acquired a little Habit and facility of Speaking in Publick, almoſt all of them give over Study and Labour. We may almoſt make the ſame Judgment of thoſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks, who tho' they Study hard, yet do not direct their Studies to the Edification of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96537:183"/>the Church. The Learning and the Studies of Divines, I ſpeak of thoſe chiefly who have Cure of Souls is often vain, and of no uſe for the edifying of their Flocks. They apply themſelves to things ſuitable to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their Studies are but their Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or their Diverſion. Now he who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the Duties of his Calling, and purſues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Employments, differs very little from him who does nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Probity is, not leſs neceſſary to Paſtors, than Knowledge and Ability; and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity ought to have three degrees.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is that Paſtors give no ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that their Life be blameleſs. This is the firſt Qualification which St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in thoſe who aſpire to this holy Office.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. III.</note> 
                     <hi>Let a Biſhop,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be blameleſs;</hi> that is, his Manners ought to be ſuch that he may not juſtly be charged with any Vice, or give any Scandal. Then the Apoſtle ſpecifies the faults from which a Paſtor ought to be free;<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. I.</note> 
                     <hi>Not given to wine, no ſtriker, not greedy of filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, but patient; not a brawler, not covetous, one that ruleth well his own houſe, having his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſubjection with all gravity, and who is not lifted up with pride and ſelf-conceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every body knows how much might be ſaid, if the Conduct of Clergy-Men was to be examined upon all theſe Heads. Are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſcandalous by the irregularity of their Manners? How groſs and ſhameful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96537:184"/>the Sin of Drunkenneſs may be, yet do they never commit it, and is not this Vice ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common among them in ſome Countries? Are not ſome of them furious and paſſionate in their Actions and Words? Do we never obſerve in them a ſordid Covetouſneſs, and an exceſſive ſtudy of Self-Intereſt? Are their Families always well ordered? Are not Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs and Pride very remarkable in ſome Perſons of that Profeſſion? Is there not often juſt Cauſe to complain, that they are implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Hatred, that they have little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that there is leſs Prepoſſeſſion, and more of Gentleneſs and true Zeal to be found among Lay-Men, than among Divines? I ſay nothing of ſome other Faults which are not leſs ſcandalous in Church-Men; as when they are given to ſwearing, when they are diſſolute and undecently free in their Words, when they are wedded to Divertiſements and Pleaſures, Worldly-minded, Lazy, Crafty, Unjuſt and Cenſorious.</p>
                  <p>When ſuch Vices appear in the Lives of Clergy-Men it is the greateſt of Scandals; from that minute the Goſpel becomes of no effect in their Mouths, the Laws of God are trampled upon, the moſt ſacred things are no longer reſpected, Divine Worſhip and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are profaned, the Miniſtry grows vile, Religion in general falls under Contempt, and the People being no longer curbed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to it, give up themſelves, to an entire Licentiouſneſs. I confeſs that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96537:184"/>ought to follow the Doctrine rather than the Example of their Guides, and that it is poſſible to profit by the Inſtructions of a Man, who does not practiſe what he teaches. But every body has not diſcretion and firmneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to ſeparate thus the Doctrine from the Example, and not to be ſhaken by the Scandal occaſioned by Church-Men, when their Life and their Preaching contradict each other. Men are very much taken with Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and govern themſelves more by Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Reaſon. A great many Perſons want nothing but Pretexts and Excuſes, to juſtifie them in ill things; and there is no pretence more ſpecious, than that which the ill Lives of the Miniſters of Religion affords. When the People ſee Men who are inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking of God and recommending Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet do not practiſe themſelves what they preach, they reject all that comes from them, they fancy that the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for Forms-ſake, and that the Maxims of Religion may be ſafely violated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires ſomewhat more in Paſtors, than not to be ſcandalous; this is but the firſt and the loweſt degree of Probity. He would have them beſides to be adorned with all manner of Virtues;<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. III. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tit. I. and II.</note> 
                     <hi>To be vigilant, prudent, grave, modeſt and given to hoſpitality, gentle, charitable, lovers of good men, wiſe juſt, holy and chaſte, ſhewing themſelves in all things patterns of good works, of purity, gravity, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96537:185"/>integrity.</hi> And indeed Paſtors are not only appointed to inſtruct and govern their Flocks, but they are obliged beſides to ſet them a good Example, and to be their Patterns; and they do not edifie leſs by their good Examples, than by their Exhortations. The Purity of their Manners, and the regularity of their Conduct, give a great Weight, to all the Functions of their Miniſtry, theſe make their Perſons venerable, and engage a great many to imitate them. Now whether theſe Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are to be found in Paſtors, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may judge. I except thoſe who ought to be excepted, but for the generality, Wherein do Church-Men differ from other Men? Do they diſtinguiſh themſelves by a regular and exemplary Life? Their Exterior indeed is ſomething different, they live more retired, they preſerve a little Decorum, tho' ever this is not done by all; but as for the reſt, are they not as much addicted to the World, and taken up with earthly things, have they not as many humane and ſecular Views, are they not as much wedded to Intereſt and other Paſſions as the bulk of Chriſtians are?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſecond degree of Probity is not ſufficient. The Life of an Hypocrite may be blameleſs and even edifying; by compoſing his Exterior he may paſs for a Saint. There is therefore a third Degree, and that is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of the Heart, a good Conſcience, a great meaſure of true Piety, Devotion, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Zeal. Paſtor ought to be in private,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96537:185"/>inwardly and in the ſight of God, what they appear to other Men. And certainly none can have greater Inducements to Piety, than a Man whoſe ordinary Buſineſs it is to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon Religion, to ſpeak of it to others, to reprove Hypocriſie and Vice; to perform Divine Service, to adminiſter the Sacraments, to viſit afflicted and dying People; and to give an account to God of a great number of Souls. I do not know whether there is a higher Degree of Impiety and Hypocriſie, than when a Man who is in theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not a good Man. Such a Man makes but Sport with the moſt ſacred things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he does properly play the part of a Comedian, and of an Hypocrite all his Life. No Profeſſion damns more certainly, than that of a Church-Man, when it is thus exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be ſaid that all theſe Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are nothing to my purpoſe; that this third degree of Probity, is neceſſary only for the Salvation of Paſtors in particular, and that as the People are unacquainted with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpoſitions of their Teachers, and are not able to diſtinguiſh true from counterfeit Piety, it is enough for their Edification, that the Exterior ſhould be well regulated. But thoſe who think this, are very much miſtaken. This want of Piety and Devotion is capital, and here we find the main Cauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs of Paſtors, and of the Corruption of the People. From whence do thoſe Faults proceed which we have obſerved in Clergy-Men?
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96537:186"/>How comes it to paſs that ſome of them are ignorant and lazy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to unprofitable Subjects and Studies, that others preach only out of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that their Diſcourſes are languid and jejune? All this, is becauſe their Hearts are void of Devotion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome preaching Matters, and thoſe too the moſt edifying which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well managed, but by a Man animated with ſincere Piety. Thoſe Preachers who deſcribe the Beauty of Virtue, or the happy State of a good Conſcience, the hopes of another Life, or the neceſſity of working out one's Salvation, and who are not affected and pierced thorough with what they ſay, do but ſtammer about theſe things, and they will hardly excite thoſe Motions in other Men's hearts, which they never felt in their own. We cannot preach with Succeſs without knowing the heart of Man, and this Knowledge ought to be the chief Study of thoſe who preach the Goſpel. But the ſureſt and the moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way to know Man's heart aright, is to conſult our own, to reflect upon our ſelves, and to have a ſpotleſs Conſcience: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this a Man is ſtill a Novice and a Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Preaching. And ſo in the Exerciſe of Diſcipline; in private Exhortations, in the viſiting of the Sick, in Prayers, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtoral Functions, there is ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing defective, when a Man does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, out of a Principle of Charity, but
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:96537:186"/>only to diſcharge the outward Obligations, which his Office lays upon him.</p>
                  <p>Pious and good Church-Men, who are not on the other hand deſtitute of Gifts, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill much better the Duties of their Miniſtry. A Paſtor who loves his Profeſſion, who lays the Functions of it to heart, who is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced of the Truths of Religion, and who practiſes the Rules of it; who in private humbles himſelf before God, and ardently implores his Bleſſing; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ho is ever intent upon ſeeking Means to Edify the Church; who turns all his Meditation that way; who thinks Day and Night of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his Flock; muſt needs be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he has in himſelf the Principle of all Benedictions and happy Succeſs. When he is Speaking or Exhorting, it is his Heart that ſpeaks, and the Language of the Heart, has a kind of Eloquence and Perſwaſiveneſs in it, which is ſoon diſcerned by the Hearers, and which always raiſes a Pious and a Zealous Preacher, above a Mercenary and Hypocritical one. The want of Piety in Paſtors, is therefore the principal Source of the Faults they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and of the Miſchiefs which proceed from their Remiſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever will ſeriouſly and without Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice Conſider all that I have now ſaid, muſt own, That the Cauſe of the Corruption of Chriſtians is chiefly to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> found in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. I do not mean to ſpeak here of all Church-men indifferently. We muſt do right
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96537:187"/>to ſome, who diſtinguiſh themſelves by their Talents, their Zeal, and the holineſs of their Lives. But the Number of theſe is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable enough to ſtop the Courſe of thoſe Diſorders which are occaſioned in the Church by the vaſt Multitudes of remiſs and corrupt Paſtors. Theſe pull down, what the others endeavour to build up. Some perhaps, will ask, Whence do all theſe Faults of the Clergy proceed? In anſwer to this Queſtion, I have Three Things to ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ought not to be thought ſtrange, that Paſtors ſhould not fulfil all the Obligations of their Office. As things are conſtituted almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where with relation to Diſcipline, to the Inſpection and Authority over Private Perſons, to the Viſiting of the Sick, and to ſome other parts of their Employment, they cannot if they would diſcharge their Duties. Neither the Magiſtrates nor the People would ſuffer it. On the other hand, the Defects of Paſtors, are the conſequences of the Contempt and Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which their Office is brought under, as well as of the Poverty they live in. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Poverty diſcourage a great many; who might otherwiſe conſiderably Edify the Church; and they are the Cauſe why Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, who have neither Education, nor Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, nor Eſtates, dedicate themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. It is commonly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that all ſorts of Perſons are good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Church; and whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> did offer their moſt Excellent Things to God,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96537:187"/>among Chriſtians, what is leaſt valued is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God and the Church. Some are devoted to the Holieſt and the moſt exalted of all Profeſſions, who would not be thought capable of an Employment of any Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Common-wealth. If then we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to remedy the Faults of the Clergy, we ſhould begin with Redreſſing what is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in the State of the Church and Religion in general.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many Eccleſiaſticks fail in the Duties of their Calling, becauſe they do not know what it obliges them to; and this they do not know, becauſe it was never Taught them. There are indeed Schools, Academies and Univerſities, which are deſigned to Inſtruct thoſe Young Men, who aſpire to this Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but I cannot tell whether Schools and Academies, as they are ordered almoſt every where, do not do more hurt than good. For firſt, as to Manners, Young People live there Licentiouſly, and are left to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The Care of Maſters and Profeſſors, does not extend to the Regulating of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Diſciples. And this Diſorder is ſo great, that in ſeveral Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Scholars and Students make publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Diſſoluteneſs. They not only live there Irregularly, but they have Priviledges, which gives them a Right to commit with impunity, all manner of Inſolencies, Brutali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Scandals, and which exempt them from the Magiſtrates Juriſdiction. It is a ſhame
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96537:188"/>to Chriſtianity, that Princes and Church-men ſhould not have yet aboliſhed thoſe Cuſtoms and Eſtabliſhments, which ſmell ſo rank of the Ignorance and Barbariſm of the Heathens. And yet theſe Univerſities are the Nurſeries out of which Paſtors, Doctors and Profeſſors are taken. Thoſe Scholars who neither have Birth, nor ſenſe of Vertue or Honour, and who have ſpent their Youth in Licentiouſneſs and Debauchery, ſpread themſelves into all Churches, and become the Depoſitaries, and in ſome meaſure the Arbitrators of Religion.</p>
                  <p>As to the Studies which are purſued at Univerſities. I obſerve in them theſe Two Faults. The firſt relates to the method of Teaching. Divinity is treated there and the Holy Scripture explained in a Scholaſtical and altogether Speculative Manner. Common Places are read, which are full of School-Terms, and of Queſtions not very material. There Young Men learn to Diſpute upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and to reſolve all Religion into Controverſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now this Method ruins them, it gives them intricate and falſe Notions of Divinity, and it begets in them Diſpoſitions directly oppoſite to thoſe which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to find out Truth.</p>
                  <p>The other Fault is more Eſſential: Little or no Care is taken in Academies, to Teach thoſe who Dedicate themſelves to the Service of the Church, ſeveral Things, the knowledge of which would be very neceſſary to them The Study of Hiſtory and of Church Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is neglected there.</p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:96537:188"/>
                  <p>Hence it is that moſt Divines, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with People, who having never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, know no other Cuſtoms or ways of living but thoſe which obtain in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. As ſoon as you take theſe Divines out of their Common-Places, they are in a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, and every thing ſeems new and ſingular to them. Morality is not taught in Divinity-Schools, but in a ſuperficial and Scholaſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> manner; And in many Academies it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> taught at all. They ſeldom ſpeak there of Diſcipline, they give few or no Inſtruction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> concerning the manner of exerciſing the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Care, or of Governing the Church. So that the greater part of thoſe who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this Office, enter into it without knowing wherein it conſiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Notion they have of it, is that it is a Profeſſion, which obliges them to preach, and to explain Texts. It were therefore to be wiſhed, that for the Glory of God, and the good of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Schools and Univerſities ſhould be reformed, and that the Manners and Studies of Young People, ſhould be better regulated in thoſe places. This Reformation would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, if Divines and Profeſſors would uſe their Endeavours about it. But thoſe kind of Eſtabliſhments are not eaſily altered. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Method is continued, and things are done as they were of Old, becauſe Men are willing to keep their Places, and the Stipends which are annexed to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third and principal Remedy would
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96537:189"/>be to uſe greater Caution, than is commonly done, when Men are to be admitted into Eccleſiaſtical Offices. The firſt Qualification to which, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> regard is to be had, is Probity and Integrity of Life. The Perſons therefore who offer themſelves, ſhould in the firſt place be examined in relation to Manners, and to all thoſe Moral Diſpoſitions, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires in them, and thoſe ſhould be excluded in whom they are not found. But this Article is commonly ſlubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, and a Young Man muſt have been very diſſolute, if he is refuſed upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Immorality. So that the moſt Sacred of all Characters, is conferred upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons, who according to the Divine Laws, ought to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>The other Part of the Examination of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates, relates to their Ability and Talents. Now in order to judge of their Capacity, it is not enough to enquire whether they know their common-Place-Book, or whether they can make a Sermon; it would be neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to examine them about the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion, about Hiſtory, Diſcipline, the holy Scripture and Morality. All theſe are important matters, the knowledge of which is of daily uſe with reference to Practice, and in the exerciſe of the Sacred Miniſtry. But they are not inſiſted upon. The exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation turns upon ſome Trials about Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon ſome Heads of Divinity, which are Scholaſtically handled, by Arguments and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96537:189"/>Diſtinctions: After which if the Canditate has ſatified in ſome Meaſure, Ordination fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>Now when ſuch Inſufficient Perſons are once admitted, the Miſchief is done, and there is no Remedy. Theſe Men are afterwards appointed Paſtors in Churches, where for 30 or 40 Years, they deſtroy more than they edify. How many Churches are there thus ill provided, where the People live in groſs Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, where the Youth are loſt for want of Inſtruction, and where a Thouſand Crimes are committed? The Cauſe of all this Evil, is in the Ordination of Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>It will no doubt be Objected, That if none were to be admitted but thoſe, who have all the neceſſary Qualifications, there would not be a ſufficient number of Paſtors, for all the Churches. To which I Anſwer, that tho' this ſhould happen, yet it were better to run into this Inconvenience than to break the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Laws of God. A ſmall number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Paſtors, is to be preferred before a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of unworthy Labourers. We are ſtill to do what God Commands, and to leave the the Event to Providence. But after all, this Scarcity of Paſtors is not ſo much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such a ſtrictneſs will only diſcourage thoſe, who would never have been uſeful in the Church, and it is a thing highly Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſhearten ſuch Perſons: But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs will encourage thoſe, who are able to do well, and the Miniſtry will be ſo much the more eſteemed and ſought after.</p>

                  <head>CAUSE IV. The Defects of Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates.</head>
                  <p>IF it had been poſſible without an eſſential Omiſſion, not to have detected this Cauſe of Corruption, I would have paſſed it over in ſilence. We ought not to ſpeak of the Higher Powers, but with great Diſcretion and Reſpect: And therefore it is not without ſome kind of Reluctancy, that I ſuppoſe in the Title of this Chapter, that one of the Cauſes of Corruption is to be found in Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates. But if I had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt this, I ſhould have diſſembled a moſt important Truth, and omitted one of the Heads, which are the moſt neceſſary to be inſiſted upon in a work of this Nature. By reaſon of the Rank which Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates hold, they have always a great ſhare in the good or ill Manners of the People. And ſo I cannot excuſe my ſelf from ſhewing, that the Corruption of Chriſtians, may partly be imputed to thoſe, who are ordained for the Government of Civil Society. In order to this I ſhall offer ſome Reflections upon the Duty of Princes and Magiſtrates, Conſidered 1. As Civil, and 2. As Chriſtian Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Although the Inſtitution of Princes and Magiſtrates does properly relate to civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet the Manner of governing their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96537:190"/>has a great Influence upon the Things of Religion. This cannot be queſtioned, if we ſuppoſe this Principle; That God who is the Author of Religion, is alſo the Author of civil Society and Magiſtracy. It is St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XIII.</note> 
                     <hi>That there is no power but of God, and that the Powers that be are ordained of God.</hi> If God is the Author of Religion, and of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society, he is alſo the Author of thoſe Laws, upon which both Religion, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society are founded. Now God being always conſiſtent with himſelf, the Laws which are derived from him, cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict one another; and this ſhews already, not only that there is no oppoſition between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Civil Society, but that theſe two things have beſides, a neceſſary relation to one another. This will yet more clearly appear, if we conſider, that Religion does not cut off Chriſtians from the Society of other Men, and that the Church does not conſtitute a State by it ſelf, to have nothing to do with Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; but that thoſe who are Members of the Church, are likewiſe Members of civil Society, ſo that the ſame Man is at the ſame time, both a Chriſtian and a Citizen.</p>
                  <p>But it is chiefly neceſſary to conſider the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion. 1. It was to be preached to all Men, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all the World, without diſtinction of Nations Kingdoms or States. In order to this, two things were neceſſary. Firſt, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96537:191"/>there ſhould be nothing in Religion, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Natural Conſtitution of States and of civil Society. For elſe, God by ordering the Goſpel to be preached, would have deſtroyed his own work, Chriſtianity could not have taken footing in the World, and the firſt Chriſtians would have been juſtly looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſeditious Perſons. But it is not leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary on the other hand, that there ſhould be nothing repugnant to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the natural Conſtitution of States and civil Society; otherwiſe God by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Society, would have put an inſuperable Obſtacle to the planting of the Goſpel, unleſs the civil Order and Government had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. But our Saviour has aſſured us that there was to be no ſuch thing, by declaring<note n="*" place="bottom">John XVIII.</note> 
                     <hi>that his kingdom was not of this world,</hi> and by commanding his Followers,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. XXII.</note> 
                     <hi>to render to Caeſar the things which are Caeſars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. One of the Chief Precepts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. XIII.</note> 
                     <hi>That all Men ſhould obey and be ſubject to the Higher Powers.</hi> Now this Precept could not poſſibly be obſerved, if in the Natural Eſtabliſhment of Civil Society, there was ſomething incompatible, with the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. VI.</note> 
                     <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters,</hi> when they command contrary things. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes further, he tells us that the preſervation of Kings, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Authory is a mean for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96537:191"/>* <hi>to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is remarkable, that whatever is good and juſt in the Civil, is ſo likewiſe in the Religious Society; and that whatever is preſcribed by Religion is juſt, and even benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Civil Society. The Law of Nature, which is the Foundation of Civil Laws, is confirmed by the Chriſtian Religion, and does perfectly agree with the Principles and Morals of the Goſpel. An evident proof of this, is, that when Chriſtian Emperors and Lawgivers did ſet about the making of Laws and Conſtitutions, they retained the eſſential parts of the Laws and Conſtitutions received among the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the time of Heatheniſm. And to this Day the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Law is followed among Chriſtians, excepting ſome Laws which have been altered or abrogated, either becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to natural Juſtice and Equity, or becauſe they were not of a general and neceſſary Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is certain, that Religion and Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do mutually ſupport one another, when both are well Regulated. Religion contributes to the happineſs of Society, by rendring the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes more Sacred and Inviolable; and the good Order of Society, contributes to the welfare and the progreſs of Religion. Let us ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate who loves Piety and Juſtice; it is plain, that at the ſame me that he promotes the Intereſt of Religion,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. II.</note> he
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:96537:192"/>ſtrengthens the welfare of Society, and that he cannot procure the good of Society, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advancing the intereſt of Religion. If we ſuppoſe on the other hand, a Magiſtrate who does not Act by the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Juſtice; it is viſible, that by ſuffering Religion to be violated or deſpiſed, he ſhakes the ſureſt Foundation of his own Authority, and of publick Tranquility, and that by failing in the Duties of his Office and in the Exerciſe of Juſtice, he makes the People grow Vicious and neglect the Duties of Piety.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Conſiderations it does manifeſtly appear, that Princes and Magiſtrates may either procure great Advantages to Religion, or do it a conſiderable prejudice, and that they are in part the Authors of the Corruption which reigns in the World.</p>
                  <p>When Civil-Society is well Governed, Men are diſpoſed by that very thing to practiſe the Duties of Chriſtianity. In proportion as the People are well Ordered, they are more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuſceptible of the impreſſions of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As they are uſed to be Governed by the Laws of the Magiſtrate, they do the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſubmit to the Holy Diſcipline of Chriſt; yea, and by Obeying Civil-Laws, they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcharge ſome part of the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But when Princes and Magiſtrates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Ignorance, or want of Probity and Vertue, give way to the violation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and good Order, it is impoſſible but that Religion muſt ſuffer by it. For beſides, that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96537:192"/>the People cannot break the Civil-Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the Principles of Religion; How can they perform the Duties of Chriſtianity, when they do not diſcharge thoſe of Nature? It is very hard to perſuade People to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Precepts of the Goſpel, who do not ſubmit to the Laws of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice. It is not to be expected that Men who do not order their outward Actions aright, ſhould regulate their Thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their Paſſions; or that being ſtrangers to the firſt Elements of Vertue, they ſhould come up to the practice of the moſt ſublime Precepts of Chriſtian Morals.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the want of Order in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice and Government, draws af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it all kinds of Diſorders with relation to Manners, ſuch as Diſhoneſty, and what is moſt dangerous, a Spirit of Libertiniſm and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which makes Men untoward and refractory to good Diſcipline. We are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here that the greateſt part of Mens Lives are taken up with Civil Matters. All Perſons are bound to Obey the Magiſtrate, and few are altogether free from Law-Suits and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that when the People are not well Governed with relation to Civil Things, they do ſo accuſtom themſelves to live without Rule of Reſtraint, that Religion can no longer have any Power over them. The neglect and remiſneſs of Princes and Magiſtrates do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all this Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>But if the bare Careleſneſs of Magiſtrates is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96537:193"/>ſo fatal to Society; how muſt it be when they themſelves are Vicious and Unjuſt, either in their own particular Conduct, or in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Office? The greateſt Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that can befal any People, is, when thoſe who are inveſted with the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, favour Injuſtice and Vice. It may be ſaid then, That the publick Fountains are poiſoned. The whole State is ordered by the Sovereigns; they are thoſe from whom the Laws receive their Force, who appoint Judges and Magiſtrates, and who regulate the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice. When inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates prevaricate, this may be remedied by the Sovereign, but when the Sovereign himſelf fails in his Duty, no redreſs can be expected.</p>
                  <p>Not but that ſubordinate Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, may likewiſe occaſion a great deal of Miſchief. If we ſuppoſe in a Province, or a Town, Magiſtrates and Judges who want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, who conſult only their Profit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Exerciſe of their Office, who are not proof againſt Bribes, who Adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from a principle of Covetouſneſs or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who Act by Recommendation or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and who are full of Artifice and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. This is enough to introduce and authorize Wickedneſs throughout their whole Juriſdiction, to pervert Right, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Juſtice and Honeſty from all Courts, to make way for Knavery and Litigiouſneſs, for the protracting of Suits, the abuſe and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oaths, and many other Diſorders.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96537:193"/>Then it is that Vice is in faſhion and repute, that Vertue and Innocency are oppreſſed, and that the People grow Corrupt. Now all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a direct undermining of Religion and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, let any Body judge, whether I have not Reaſon to ſay, that the Corruption of the Age may be imputed to Princes and Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe Evils are yet more unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Princes or Magiſtrates who are the Authors of them, profeſs the Chriſtian Religion. A Heathen Magiſtrate has not by much that influence upon Religion and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that a Chriſtian has. The Church was purer and more ſeparated from the World, when the Superior Powers were contrary to it; but as ſoon as the Emperors had embraced Chriſtianity, Piety and Zeal did viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. Not but that Religion may receive, and has actually received great Helps from Chriſtian Magiſtrates; they have ſometimes contributed very effectually to the promoting of Piety, and thoſe who do ſo, deſerve im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Honour. But it muſt likewiſe be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Vices and ill Examples of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Corrupt the Church more, than if it were under Heathen Governors.</p>
                  <p>The Duty of Chriſtian Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as well as of all the Members of the Church, is double. They are bound, Firſt, to ſerve God and to diſcharge the Obligations which Religion lays upon all Men; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to take care, that God may be ſerved and honoured by all thoſe, who are ſubject to their Authority.</p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:96537:194"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Every Chriſtian ought to ſerve God and to live according to the Precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. That very thing then that a Magiſtrate is Chriſtian, obliges him to be a lover of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Virtue. It is a Common Notion eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among great Men, that Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion do not become thoſe who are exalted to Dignities, and that publick Perſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re not to be ruled by the Maxims of Religion. But whoſoever maintains this Opinion, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Principles of Religion, and be either an Atheiſt or a Deiſt. For ſuppoſing the Truth of Chriſtianity, it is beyond all doubt, that a Chriſtian Prince or Magiſtrate, has as much need of Piety as other Men have. He is bound to be a good Man by the ſame duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which engage private Men to be ſo; he has a Soul to be ſaved as well as they; and as he is a publick Perſon, he is to give an account of his conduct to that Judge, with whom there is no acception of Perſons, and before whom the greateſt of Monarchs, is no more than the Meaneſt of Slaves.</p>
                  <p>If the eminent Station of a Magiſtrate makes ſome difference between him and Chriſtians of a lower Order, that difference obliges him to a higher degree of Piety. The Character he bears requires a great ſtock of Virtue. No ſmall meaſure of Probity is requiſite to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthily in that Calling; to do no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not to ſeek in his Dignities the means to gratifie his Intereſt, his Vanity, his Pride, or his other Paſſions. Without a firm and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96537:194"/>Virtue, he cannot withſtand thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations which offer themſelves every minute, and which are the more dangerous and ſubtil, becauſe in thoſe exalted Poſts, ill things, for the moſt part, may be done with ſafety. If we add to all this, that an ill Magiſtrate is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the greateſt part of the Diſorders which happen, and of the Crimes which are committed in Society, it muſt be confeſſed that Magiſtracy is a kind of Life, wherein Piety is extreamly neceſſary, and in which, great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and a ſublime Virtue, are the only Preſervatives againſt a thouſand oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, of tranſgreſſing the Duties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and violating the moſt Sacred Laws of Religion and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is the duty of Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates, to labour for the promoting of Virtue and the ſuppreſſing of Vice among Men. We have ſhewn already that it is their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to do ſo, ſince Religion is the ſureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Authority, and of the Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their People; but their Duty does beſides indiſpenſably oblige them to this. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that this Obligation lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſince every Chriſtian is bound to advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, and to edify his Neighbours as much as he can in that State and Condition he is in. The Duty here is anſwerable to the abilitry, ſo that we may apply to this purpoſe, that Maxim of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke XII.</note> 
                     <hi>that to whom ſoever much is given, of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96537:195"/>him much ſhall be required.</hi> Private Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do much towards promoting the Glory of God; their Zeal and Good intentions are for the moſt part uſeleſs; it is not in their power to hinder general diſorders, this ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be done by Men of Authority, and they may do it eaſily. Beſides, a Chriſtian Magiſtrate is to conſider that it was Providence which raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Poſt he is in, and that by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he is engaged in Juſtice and Gratitude, to uſe his Authority for the Glory of God. Laſtly, Would it not be a ſtrange thing, that Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates ſhould do no Service to Religion, when Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who are not Chriſtian, can do ſo much hurt to it? Now they may advance the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and baniſh Corruptions, theſe two ways. 1. By their Example. 2. By their Care.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By their Example. This Method is of great efficacy. Examples are very forcible, but their effect, depends for the moſt part upon the Quality and Character of the Perſons they come from. It has been made appear in the foregoing Chapter, how much benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Church, from the good Lives and Examples of the Governours of it. But the example of Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates is in ſome reſpects of greater weight. When a Church-Man recommends Virtue by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Life, it is often ſaid that his Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obliges him to live ſo, and this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes his to be example of little force upon
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96537:195"/>worldly-minded Men. But when Princes and Magiſtrates are pious, thoſe Men have no ſuch thing to ſay. The Splendor and Authority which ſurround Greatneſs, gives much credit to every thing that comes from great Men. They may ſometimes do more good with one word, than a Preacher can do by many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewed in the firſt Part of this Work that one of the greateſt Obſtacles to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is a falſe Shame which reſtrains Men from doing their Duty, for fear of being obſerved and deſpiſed; and I am to ſhew hereafter, that Cuſtom has introduced among Chriſtians a great many Maxims and Practices contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel. Theſe two things occaſion Corruption and till they are remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Vice and Impiety muſt ſtill reign. But the Example of great Men is ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move almoſt intirely, both theſe Springs of Corruption. They are the Judges of Honour and Cuſtom; it is in their power to make any thing which is reputed ſhameful, to be thought Honourable; and to aboliſh that which is generally received. So that how ſcarce and deſpeſed ſoever Piety may be, an Idea of Honour would be affixed to it, if it was favoured and profeſſed by great Men, and that would be reſpected in them, which in others, is looked upon with Indifference or Contempt.</p>
                  <p>That which has happened with relation to Duels is a ſtrong proof of what I ſay. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96537:196"/>fighting a Duel, has been thought for a long time a Diſgrace and an Infamy: A falſe notion of Honour did then bear down the ſtrongeſt Principles of Nature, Reaſon and Chriſtianity; and drive Men to that exceſs of Brutality and Madneſs, that they would cut one anothers Throat for a trifle. But in thoſe places where Chriſtian Princes have aboliſhed D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>els, People are now of another mind, and think it no ſhame to refuſe a Challenge. And thus Swearing, Drunkenneſs, and the greateſt of other clamorous Sins, might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, if great Men pleaſed. Is it not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved beſides, that when a Prince is devout, Devotion comes into faſhion? It may be that this Devotion which proceeds from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Princes, is not always ſincere; but at leaſt it regulates Manners as to the exterior; and ſuch an outward Reformation, may be a ſtep towards true Devotion. However this ſhews that the opinion and example of Men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, has a great power. And ſurely if by their credit they can make Vice it ſelf to be honoured, would it not be much eaſier for them, to make other Men honour Virtue, ſince it is honourable in its own Nature?</p>
                  <p>I am not able to expreſs of what Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Example of great Men is, either for Good or Evil. A Prince who is vicious, cruel, diſſolute, artificious or unjuſt, is enough to infect a whole State in a very little time, to baniſh Piety from it, and to bring into repute Drunkenneſs, Lewdneſe, Cheating, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96537:196"/>and all the other Vices which he allows himſelf in. This we find by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Such as the Prince is, ſo are thoſe about him; and from theſe, the Evil ſpreads upon the whole People, by reaſon of the Credit and Authority to which they were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and of the Influence they have upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Affairs. What might not be ſaid here of the Life which is led in the Courts of Princes? Excepting ſome few Courts where Licentiouſneſs is not ſuffered. That kind of Life which is followed at Court, for the generality, agrees little with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtianity. People live there altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a looſe and worldly manner, in Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Idleneſs, Pomp and Pleaſure. There, the ſtrongeſt and the moſt inticing Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be met with, and the moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intrigues, Adultery it ſelf, are rather a Matter of Railery, than Reproach. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible for a Man to inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Favour of Princes, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Fortune at Court, unleſs he makes it his Maxim to diſſemble his Sentiments, and to ſpeak directly againſt his own Thoughts. The worſt of it is, that from thence Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diffuſes it ſelf almoſt every where; ſo that many Diſorders which are in Vogue, would be unknown, or at leaſt very rare in the World, if they had not been introduced by that Licentiouſneſs, which reigns in the Courts of Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I come now to the Endeavours, which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96537:197"/>Chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to uſe, for the Edification of the Church and the reviving of Piety; theſe Endeavours relate either to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Matters, or to Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Civil Matters, it is their Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Libertiniſm and Corruption, by regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Manners of their Subjects, either by repealing the Laws and Cuſtoms which do not agree with Religion, and which engage the People into the violation of the Precepts of the Goſpel, or by reforming the Abuſes which are introduced from time to time, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe which creep into the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. In relation to all theſe things, there are ſeveral Faults which the Church cannot provide againſt, and which nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but the Magiſtrates Authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other Care relates directly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. 1. Princes and Kings profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, are bound to procure, as much as in them lies, the Welfare of the Church. They ought to ſet about the eſtabliſhing of Truth and Peace, provided that in order to that, they uſe no Means but ſuch, as are ſutable to the Goſpel. They ought by their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee that the Church and Religion want nothing of what is neceſſary, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Order and Decency; that Divine Service be duly performed; that there be both Places for that Purpoſe, and a ſufficient number of Perſons to take care of the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; that thoſe Perſons may ſubſiſt honourably, that they do their Duty
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96537:197"/>and keep themſelves within the bounds of their Calling. They muſt not ſuffer Church Goods or Revenves to be applied to uſes meerly Civil; and when theſe Revenues are not ſufficient, it becomes their Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to allot ſome part of the publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, for the neceſſities of the Church. In fine, as to Manners, I obſerved before, that they may eaſily give a ſtop to Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, to Luxury, Swearing, and other Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals which diſhonour the Church. And if they can do this, they ought to do it, every Chriſtian being bound to do all that is in his Power, to promote the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is certain that Magiſtrates who are Members of the Church, ought to protect it, to maintain the Order which God has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in it, and not to ſuffer any breach to be made there. So that tho' they may regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late many things which concern Religion, and tho' the Church owes them a great Regard, yet they cannot without Uſurpation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, arrogate to themſelves the whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, with relation to Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. They are neither the Princes nor the Heads of the Church, as they are the Princes and the Heads of Civil Society. An Authority ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to theirs, has inſtituted, Religion, Paſtors and Diſcipline. There is a Law enacted by the KING of Kings, and the Head of the Church, which clearly determines the Rights and Duties, both of the Church and of the Governour of it All theſe are Sacred things,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96537:198"/>which earthly Powers are not to meddle with. They are Laws which Princes and Magiſtrates did ſubmit to, when they became Members of the Church; with reſpect to theſe I mean ſtill eſſential things appointed by the Word of God) they have acquired no Right by embracing Chriſtianity; ſince he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Member of a Society, cannot by that acquire a Right to alter the natural Form and Conſtitution of it.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtance of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhews that a Prince who profeſſes true Religion, may interpoſe in the Affairs of it: But we muſt take care not to carry this Inſtance too far, as thoſe do, who aſcribe to the Magiſtrate, a ſupreme Authority in the Church, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a Right to order every thing there; not excepting Diſcipline, the calling of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, nor even the Articles of Faith. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that under the Law, Kings were by no means the Judges of every thing, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Religion; we are not to argue altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Chriſtian Religion, from what was done in the Jewiſh Church. Among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e <hi>Jews</hi> the Church and the State were mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in ſome meaſure undiſtinguiſhed from one another. That meerly ſpiritual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety which is called the Church, and which is confined to no State, or People, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Form of Civil Government; was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly erected ſince the coming of Chriſt. God acted among the <hi>Jews</hi> as a Civil Magiſtrate.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96537:198"/>The Laws of the Jewiſh Religion were for the moſt part external Laws, which might and ought to be maintained by Force and Authority. The Rights of Divine Service, and the Functions of Prieſts, were very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Evangelical Worſhip and from the Office of Chriſtian Paſtors. After all, if we ſhould go by the practice of the Jewiſh Church, it would follow, that the Miniſters of Religion are inveſted with Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a very great Authority too. The Jewiſh Prieſts held a conſiderable Rank in the State, as well as in Religion. If upon ſome occaſions Kings have depoſed Prieſts; upon other occaſions Prieſts have oppoſed Kings and altered the Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Chron. XXIII. and XXVI.</note>So that without preſſing too much thoſe Inſtances out of the Old Teſtament, the beſt way is to conſult the New, and to proceed according to the Laws of the Apoſtles, and the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion. And whoſoever examins without Prejudice thoſe Sacred Books, which have been writ ſince the Coming of our Saviour, will acknowledge, that things are now altered, and that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates have but a limited Authority in Matters of Religion. It is remarkable, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never mentions them, when it ſpeaks of the Church and of the Government of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3, And yet as the Authority of Princes and Magiſtrates, is derived from God, it ought ſtill to ſubſiſt entire. And therefore they have
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96537:199"/>an unqueſtionable Right, to take care that nothing be done in the Church, to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their lawful Authority, and of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquility; and that the Miniſters of Religion do not ſtretch their Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſpiritual things. The Honour and the Safety of Religion, require that this Principle ſhould be laid down; for Religion, as was ſaid before, ought not, to diſturb Society, and true Religion will never diſturb it. If then any Chriſtians or Church-men under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, ſhould break in upon the Civil Government, and the publick Peace, Kings and Princes have a Right to reſtrain them, and then they do not oppoſe Religion, but thoſe only who abuſe and diſhonour it.</p>
                  <p>After theſe Conſiderations, I think any Man is able to judge, whether the decay of Piety and Religion, is not in part to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates. We need but enquire whether both in Civil and Religious Matters, they obſerve the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have now deſcribed. I ſay no more of this, becauſe every body is able to make the Application.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt add, that if the want of Zeal in Magiſtrates is enough to introduce Confuſion and Vice into the Church; the Miſchief is much greater, when not only, they do not what they ought for the good of Religion, but when they uſe their Authority beſides, to the prejudice of it. I cannot forbear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning here two great Abuſes.</p>

                  <p>The Firſt is, when Princes and Magiſtrates aſſume the whole Authority to themſelves, ſo that except Preaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, they will do every thing in the Church: When they preſume to determine Articles of Faith, to rule the Conſcience of their Subjects, and to force them to embrace one Perſuaſion rather than another; when they will by all means take upon them to call Paſtors, without regard to that Right of the Church and Church-men, which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Scripture, and confirned by the practice of the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; when they ſeize upon Church-Eſtates, tho' there is no Reaſon to fear that Wealth ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their Clergy, and tho' ſuch Revenues might be applied to ſeveral pious Uſes, and particularly to the Relief of Country-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, moſt of which are not ſufficiently edified, for want of neceſſary Endowments and Funds. A great deal might be ſaid about that which was done in the laſt Century with relation to Church-Revenues; and it were to be wiſhed, that People had been a little more ſcrupulous than they were, when they invaded the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Church, and confounded them with the Revenues of the State.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this the Magiſtrates Authority is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Church, when he hinders the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of true Diſcipline, and when he ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſuch Regulations as he thinks fit, in the room of Apoſtolical Laws. This is one of the greateſt Obſtructions to the reſtoring of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96537:200"/>Apoſtolical Diſcipline. Tho' the Church and her Paſtors ſhould be willing to obſerve the ancient Order, and to oppoſe Corruption by thoſe Means which the Goſpel enjoins, yet this is not to be done, if thoſe who have the Authority in their hands will not give way to it. The Church is not in a Condition to reſiſt, and to make head againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, when he uſes Force; and She ought not to do it, if She could.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Abuſe is, when the Magiſtrate makes it his buſineſs to abaſe Religion, in the Perſons of its Miniſters, by deſpoiling them as much as he can, of every thing that might procure them Reſpect and Authority in the Church. This Policy is as contrary to the Intereſt of Religion, and to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Piety, as it is common now adays, in ſeveral Chriſtian Dominions. It is well done of the Magiſtrate to preſerve his Authority, and to keep the Clergy from exceeding the bounds of their Calling; but from thence it does not follow, that he ought to trample them under foot, to bring them under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Contempt, and to vilifie their Character, which after all is Sacred and Venerable. This is to ſacrifice Religion to Policy and Pride, and this Proceeding is a manifeſt Cauſe of the Contempt of Religion, and of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which neceſſarily follows that Contempt, ſince commonly, nothing is more deſpiſed in the World, than that which great Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:96537:200"/>
                  <p>I declare it once more, by all that has been ſaid, I do not mean to detract any thing from the Reſpect due to Civil Powers, neither do I ſpeak of all Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates, among whom there are ſome who have Piety and Zeal, and who labour with ſucceſs, for the Good of Religion. But the Glory of God requires, that we ſhould ſpeak the truth, ſo that I could not but take notice of this Cauſe of Corruption. Upon the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is to be hoped; that if Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates would be pleaſed to make ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon all theſe things, we ſhould ſoon ſee an end of ſome of theſe Diſorders; and that a happier time will come when they will uſe their Authority, to advance the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and to reſtore Truth, Piety and Peace among Chriſtians.</p>

               <div n="5" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE V. Education.</head>
                  <p>NOthing is more natural than to look for the Original of Corruption in the time at which it begins; I mean in the firſt years of Life. It is not only when Men have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a ripeneſs of Age, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Vice, but that Inclination diſcovers it ſelf from their Youth. The Root of that Ignorance, of thoſe Prejudices, and of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96537:201"/>greateſt part of the ill Diſpoſitions they are in, may be found in their tender years. We had need then look back upon the beginnings of Life, and ſeek in Youth, and in Infancy it ſelf, the Source of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>When we enter upon this Enquiry, and conſider that Men, if nothing reſtrains them, will run into Vice from their Youth, out of a propenſion which is common to all, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but perceive at firſt ſight, that there muſt be in them a certain Principle of Corruption, which makes them thus prone to ill things. But if we reflect upon this Matter with any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, we may likewiſe be ſatisfied, that it would not be impoſſible to rectifie at leaſt in part, that vicious Inclination, and to prevent the fatal Conſequences of it, by the means of Education; and that it is chiefly the wrong Method of educating Children, which feeds that Diſpoſition to Evil, and which encreaſes and ſtrengthens it. This is what I intend to ſhew in this Chapter. I hope to make it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, that the Corruption of Men, is to be imputed to the Education they had in their Youth; and that conſidering how Children are brought up, it is impoſſible, but that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Vice, muſt generally prevail in the World. I ſhall begin with general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, upon the Education of Children, and in the next place I ſhall ſpeak of their Education, with a particular Regard to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Reflection is, that the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96537:201"/>for the moſt part of People who have no Education and whoſe Unhappineſs it is to have been wholly neglected in their youth. This may particularly be obſerved among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of mean Birth. Every body knows that ſuch kind of People, have no manner of Education; that from their Childhood they are abandoned to themſelves, without either Inſtruction, Correction, or any other help, and that living with ignorant groſs and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents between worldly buſineſs and ill examples, they ſpend their youth almoſt like Brutes.</p>
                  <p>This firſt Reflection, which may be applied to many Thouſand Chriſtians, diſcovers to us already a plain reaſon of the extream Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which appears in their Manners. We wonder ſometimes that Men are ſo depraved, and that great Multitudes of them have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no Senſe at all, either of Religion or Conſcience, or of Reaſon and Humanity. We think it ſtrange, that there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, Impious Perſons, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Name of God, Thieves, Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Men who defile themſelves with the moſt infamous Sins, and who make Conſcience of nothing. One would think Humane Nature were not capable of ſuch Enormities; and yet they committed by a great many. But we may eaſily apprehend how this comes to paſs, if we conſider what Education thoſe Perſons had. Inſtead of being brought up like Chriſtians, they have not ſo much as been
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96537:202"/>educated like Rational Creatures. The Light of Nature has been extinguiſhed in them from their very Infancy, ſo that having ſcare any Notion of Good or Evil, they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Vice without ſcruple or remorſe, almoſt in the ſame manner as the Heathens did of Old.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But as this total Defect of Education is not univerſal, ſo we are to enquire in the Second place, How Children are bred up, and to obſerve here the principal Faults which are committed about their Education.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Education of Children is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ſoon enough, nothing is done to them in the firſt Years of their Lives. As ſoon as Children begin to have ſome kind of Reaſon, the firſt Principles of Virtue ſhould be inſtill'd into them. For tho' the Ideas and Actions of young Children are very confuſed, yet it is in Infancy that Paſſions and Habits begin to ſpring up. At 3 or 4 Years Old, Children give ſome ſigns of what they are to be all their Lives, and from that time it may be known, what their predominant Inclinations will be. If that time was well improved, it would be an eaſy and compendious way to give Children a good Education. They may then without any great trouble be made to do thoſe things, which they cannot be brought to without much time and difficulty, when they are once come to 14 or 15; ſome little Care and gentle Correction, may ſtifle a Paſſion in its birth, is may cure Anger and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96537:202"/>Stubbornneſs in a Child, it may ſoften his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and make him obedient and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. A little caution uſed about his Diet, may render him ſober and temperate for his whole Life. But that time which is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, is that, wherein Children are moſt neglected.</p>
                  <p>This delay of Education proceeds from Two Cauſes. 1. That Men have not a true Notion of the Education of Children, and of the End to be aimed at in it. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined, that the Breeding up of Children, is the Teaching them Latin, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Trade, or ſome other Things, which are uſually Taught them, in order to ſit them for thoſe Callings to which they are deſigned. And as Children are not capable of applying themſelves to Arts and Sciences before a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Age, ſo their Education is deferred till then. But if Men did well underſtand, that the chief deſign of Education, is to form the Judgment and the Temper of Children, they would not ſtay ſo long before they took care of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt Years of Children are neglected, and their Conduct then is not much minded, becauſe Vice does not then ſhew it ſelf in all its Deformity. All that they do is then look'd upon as innocent, and every thing in them appears pleaſant, not excepting their very Faults. If they are too Lively, or of a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Humour, if they happen to be in a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to Lye, to ſpeak undecent and filthy
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96537:203"/>Words, to do little ſly naught Tricks; all this for the moſt part, makes only People laugh, commend and applaud them. It is not conſidered, that theſe are the fore-runners of Vice, and that theſe beginnings call for a ſpeedy remedy. Young Children are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Crimes: Impiety, Uncleanneſs, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and premeditated Malice, are not to be found in them, but if we narrowly obſerve them, we may ſpy out the ſeeds and the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of thoſe Vices, in their Actions and Manners. This is not much taken notice of; Paſſions and ill Habits are ſuffered to grow quietly during Childhood, and they are quite formed and ſettled before they are obſerved. At Seven or Eight Years of Age, Innocency is already loſt, and the Heart is corrupted. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple begin to think of Educating their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when the fitteſt ſeaſon for Education is paſt, and when they have already thoſe Principles of Corruption in them, which they will never ſhake off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no care taken to form the Mind and Judgment of Children. Reaſon being the moſt eſſential Property of Men, is that which ought to be chiefly cultivated in Young People; and all that they are Taught beſides, is of little uſe, if they are not accuſtomed to this. Great labour is uſed to learn them Languages and Sciences, their Memory is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, they are loaded with ſeveral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, their Heads are filled with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Words and Ideas; but it would be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96537:203"/>without compariſon more important, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their Judgment. Whatever they may be deſigned for, no greater good can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to them, than to make them able to paſs a ſound Judgment upon Things, and to govern themſelves by Reaſon. True Senſe is neceſſary at all times, and it is of a general Uſefulneſs in our whole Life. It is therefore an unhappineſs for Children that in this reſpect they are ſo much neglected. Men have not the Patience to reaſon with them, and to Teach them to Speak and to Act wiſely. They are ſuffered to be among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who can neither Speak nor Reaſon, they converſe for the moſt part, only with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or other Children. By this means they accuſtom themſelves to take up falſe Notions, to judge of Things only by their appearances, to reſolve raſhly and without Conſideration, and to be governed only by their Senſes, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Prejudices. From thence proceed almoſt all the Faults which they commit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; but this is eſpecially the Cauſe of that affection which Men bear to Sin, and to the Things of this World. The firſt Quality of a Chriſtian, is to be a Rational Man; it being impoſſible that a Man who cannot make uſe of his Reaſon, and who has no Senſe, ſhould judge aright of Spiritual Things, curb his Paſſions, renounce his Prejudices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follow the Rules of his Duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall not here enumerate all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Faults which are ſuffered in Children;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96537:204"/>but there are two which I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, becauſe I look upon them as the cauſe of moſt of the Paſſions and Vices, ſo which Men are addicted. Firſt there are no ſufficient endeavours uſed to make Children tractable, and to ſubject them to the Will of others. The ground-work of a good Education is to keep them in Awe and Obedience; and not to let them grow independent, and obſtinate in their own Will and Paſſions; ſo that when we command or forbid them a thing it is by all means neceſſary to make them obey. When we obſerve in them too ſtrong an Inclination to any thing, tho' the thing were innocent, yet becauſe they deſire it too earneſtly, they are not always to be indulged in it. But care is to be taken, that when we Croſs their Will, we do it with Mildneſs, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as may give them to underſtand, that it is with reaſon and for their good, we oppoſe them, and not out of humour, or only to vex them. When Children are thus dealt with, they may be turned which way ſoever we pleaſe. It keeps them from ſtubbornneſs and Self-love, it teaches them to overcome their Deſires, to ſubmit to Corrections, and to follow the Advice which is give them. In a word, Tractableneſs in a Child, is a diſpoſition to every thing that is good, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Virtues. But no good can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Child who is not docile and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. If he is permitted while young to be independent, and to do what he liſts, he
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:96537:204"/>will be much more abſolute, when he comes to a riper Age.</p>
                  <p>The other Fault, which it is very neceſſary to prevent is the love of the Body and of the Objects of Senſe. A carnal Temper, is by the teſtimony of Scripture it ſelf, the root of all Vices. But the firſt riſe of that irregular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which Men bear to every thing that gratifies their Body, is in their Infancy. For beſides, that Children govern themſelves only by ſenſe; that Byaſs they have towards ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, is forfeited by the ſenſual Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is beſtowed upon them. None but groſs and Material Objects, are propoſed to them; they are entertained only with thoſe things, which affect the Senſes, and no Ideas but thoſe of bodily Pleaſures or Pains, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in them. The Promiſes and 'Threats, the Rewards and Puniſhments, which are uſed to gain upon them, relate only to Corporeal things. And here it ought not to be omitted, that they are chiefly ſpoiled, by being indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in Gluttony and the Vanity of Cloaths. Theſe are the two firſt Paſſions of Children; the two Inclinations, by which they begin to grow Corrupt and to love the World; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes ſo much impreſſion upon them as that which affects their Eyes or their Palate.</p>
                  <p>If Children were uſed to a ſimplicity of Diet and Apparel, this would preſerve them, from many dangerous Vices and Paſſions; it would diſpoſe them for thoſe Virtues, which are the moſt neceſſary to a Wiſe Man and a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96537:205"/>Chriſtian; it would inure them to Sobriety, Labour, Prudence, Humility, to the Contempt of Pleaſure, and to Firmneſs and Patience in Calamities. This would make their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſtronger, and prevent divers Infirmities, which both afflict and ſhorten their lives. But ill Cuſtom prevails againſt the Maxims of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Chriſtianity. Little caution is uſe in relation to their Diet; they are ſuffered to eat much beyond that which Nature requires, and they are accuſtomed to be liquoriſh and dainty in their eating. As for Cloaths and Decking, Fathers and more eſpecially Mothers, have that Weakneſs, that they love to ſee their Children fine and ſpruce. Beſides this, the way of breeding up Children of the better ſort, makes them ſoft, effeminate and lovers of Pleaſure. The fruit of ſuch an Education, is, that Children become Slaves to their Bodies and to their Senſes; they are taken with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bodily Pleaſures and worldly Things. From thence Spring in proceſs of time; Intemperance, Uncleanneſs, Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and moſt of the greater kind of Sins. This is likewiſe the principal cauſe of Indevotion, and of the little reliſh which Men find in ſpiritual Things, particularly in Religion and Piety. A ſenſual Education oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions all theſe Evils.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It will not be improper to obſerve here, that frequently the Education which is given to thoſe Children, who are deſtined to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? and conſiderable Employments, either
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96537:205"/>in the Church or in Civil Society, does but corrupt their Inclinations. They are ſent to Colleges and Univerſities, where being truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with themſelves, they live in Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Libertiniſm; and they are ſent thither at an Age, in which without a kind of Miracle, they cannot fail of being undone. They are as it were emancipated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of their Parents; they are expoſed without defence to the moſt dangerous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and that at the very time, when they are the moſt unfit to regulate their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the moſt ſuſceptible of ill Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and vicious Examples. Children would be much better Educated with relation both to Sciences and good Manners, if their Parents did not make ſo much haſte, and if they did not ſpur them on to Study, till their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a little formed, and eſpecially if they took care to confirm them in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion and Virtue, before they were ſent from Home. Some alteration ſhould likewiſe be made in Colleges. For the very Studies which Youths purſue there, are inſtrumental to Debauch them. They learn Latin and Obſcenity together. Authors are put into their Hands, the reading of whom raiſes impure Ideas in their Minds; and as if there was a deſign to ſtifle in them all ſenſe of Modeſty, they are made to interpret and to rehearſe very undecent things. When all is well conſidered, young People acquire but little of uſeful Learning in Colleges and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:96537:206"/>Academies, at the rate they live and ſtudy in thoſe Places; and there too they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave their Innocency.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The means of procuring to Children a happy Education, are not uſed as they ſhould be. Theſe Means are Inſtruction, Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and Correction.</p>
                  <p>Inſtruction is very much neglected, as I ſhall more particularly ſhew, when I come to ſpeak of the Education of Youth with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Religion. Parents ſeldom give good Directions to their Children, to teach them how they ought to live. They do worſe; they train them up to ill things, and give them bad Inſtruction. By the Diſcourſe and the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims they utter in the hearing of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they infuſe Sentiments and Principles of Covetouſneſs, Pride, Senſuality and Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into them; they teach them to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Motives of Intereſt and Paſſion, or by the Notions of a falſe Honour. Nay, they do ſometimes directly teach them Vice, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to Lye and Cheat, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful and Paſſionate. So that Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not only deſtitute of good Inſtructions, but they are beſides, infected from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy with ſeveral moſt pernicious Principles. I need not ſay, what the Conſequences of ſuch an Education are like to be.</p>
                  <p>If few Children are formed to Virtue by Inſtruction, few are made Virtuous by the good Example of their Parents. It is much when this Example is not bad and dangerous.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:96537:206"/>In moſt Families Children ſee nothing that Savours of Chriſtianity, except ſome external Acts of Religion; they obſerve that every one of the Family is imployed about Temporal things; the diſcourſes they hear, turn altogether on Intereſt, or ſome trifling Subject. They are Witneſſes of a great many Diſorders, of the Heats and Quarrels of their Fathers and Mothers, of their Avarice, their Swearing their Lying, their Intemperance, their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their want of Reſpect for Religion. Theſe are the Examples which, for the moſt part, Children have before their Eyes, and which Corrupt them more than any thing elſe. At that Age almoſt every thing is done by Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Example; and no Example makes more Impreſſion upon them, than the Example of their Parents, becauſe it is always in ſight; and they think beſides they cannot do amiſs, as long as they Copy after it.</p>
                  <p>It is very uſeful in educating Children to encourage them. I mean not only that they ſhould be exhorted and incited to their Duty, and that, from the Motives of Honour and from the pleaſure that attends the doing of it; but that likewiſe, we ſhould expreſs our Satisfaction, and our love and eſteeem of them, when they do as we would have them. A Word of Praiſe, a little Reward, inſpires new Ardor into them. We may do what we pleaſe with Children, when we can prevail upon them with gentle Methods, and win their Love: They then accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96537:207"/>betimes to do their Duty, out of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and from noble and generous Views. But to uſe always Severity towards Children, and to take no notice of their Endeavours to do well, is the way to diſcourage them, and to extinguiſh in them the Love of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>Yet Severity is neceſſary, and upon ſome occaſions we ought not to forbear Rigour and Correction. Thoſe indulgent Parents, who being reſtrained by a falſe Tenderneſs, cannot find in their heart to Chaſtiſe their Children, do infallibly ruin them. But if the want of Correction and Diſcipline makes Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly; Chaſtiſement ill diſpenſed produces the ſame effect. There are commonly three Faults committed in the Correcting of Children.</p>
                  <p>The firſt relates to the Cauſe for which they are chaſtiſed. Correction ſhould not be uſed but for thoſe Faults, which have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Vice in them; as when Children are guilty of Malice, of ſome ill Habit, or of great Negligence; and even then we ſhould not proceed to Chaſtiſement, but after we have tried other ways to no purpoſe. But this Rule is little obſerved. Children are puniſhed for all ſorts of Faults indifferently, and very often for ſmall ones. They will ſometimes be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſed, becauſe they can not ſay their Leſſon without Book, or for ſome other little diſorder they have done in the Houſe through Imprudence and without Malice; and at the ſame time Faults againſt Piety and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:96537:207"/>ſhall be paſſed over. Theſe Corrections produce ſeveral ill effects, and eſpecially this, that Children form to themſelves falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Duty. The fancy that the Faults for which they are puniſhed are the moſt conſiderable, and that there is more hurt in ſpoiling their Cloaths, or in miſſing a word of their Leſſon, that in Lying, or in praying without attention, which leſſens in them the Abhorrence of Vice.</p>
                  <p>The Second Error, which relates to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Correction inflicted upon Children, is when no other Chaſtiſements are uſed but thoſe which make the Body ſmart. Such Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections without doubt are uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe Children are chiefly moved by thoſe things which ſtrike the Senſes; but they are not the only Ones to which recourſe is to be had. To beat Children every time they do amiſs, is to uſe them like Beaſts. There are other ways of puniſhing are mortifying them. The moſt profitable Corrections are thoſe, which excite in them Sorrow and Shame for the ill they have done.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is an Error in the Chaſtiſing of Children, when they are not Corrected with Diſcretion and Gentleneſs. Prudence and even Juſtice requires, that regard ſhould be had to the Nature of their Fault, to the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are in, and to other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and it becomes that Love which a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owes his Children, to Correct them with Lenity and Moderation, and to forbear exceſſive
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96537:208"/>Severities. Children ſhould perceive the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of their Parents, even in their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and be made ſenſible that it is with Reluctancy, and only in order to their Good, that they treat them with ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. If Chaſtiſements were diſpenſed with theſe Cautions, they would at the ſame time that they cauſe Pain, beget in Childrens Minds, a Sorrow for having done amiſs, and they would make them love their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, even while they are Puniſhing them. But for the moſt part, Parents, or thoſe who have an Authority over Children, Chaſtiſe them without Diſcretion, and with a Rigour which borders upon Cruelty; they puniſh them rather out of Paſſion, Spite or Revenge, than upon wiſe and ſober Conſideration. Such a proceeding diſcourages and provokes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and it makes them hate their Duty. I confeſs this Method may ſtrike Terror into them, and Curb them a little, but they grow the more ſtout and incorrigible by it, and they will certainly run into Licentiouneſs, aſſoon as they are no longer reſtrained by the fear of Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid hitherto, it is plain that Men's Corruption, is a conſequence of the Education they had in their Youth: But this will yet more evidently appear, by the Reflections I am now going to make, upon the way of bringing up Children in Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>We are here to conſider Education, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:96537:208"/>to the two Ends of it, which are the educating of Youth, Firſt in the Knowledgwe, and then in the Practice of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Conſiderations to be inſiſted on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt Head, relate either to the Things which Children are to be Inſtructed in, or to the manner of Inſtructing them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Things themſelves, there are Two Articles upon which the Inſtruction of Youth ought to depend; and thoſe are the Truths, and the Duties of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The chief Rule to be obſerved with relation to the Truths of Religion, is to inſiſt upon thoſe, which are the moſt neceſſary, and to give a diſtinct Notion of them to Children. And here Two Faults are committed; The firſt is, when they are not Inſtructed in all the Truths which are to be known in order to be a Chriſtian; the ſecond is, when ſuch Inſtructions are propoſed to them as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to their Age, or even uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>To explain my Meaning a little further; I ſay Firſt, that there are ſome eſſential things, which Children are not at all, or but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly taught. Among theſe we may reckon the knowledge of Sacred Hiſtory. Religion being founded upon Hiſtory. Religion being founded upon Hiſtory and Facts, it would be requiſite that Inſtruction ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the Hiſtorical part of Religion, and at the main Events which are related both in the Old and New Teſtament: ſo that Children might know at leaſt in general, the principal Ages of the World, and the moſt remarkable
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:96537:209"/>things, which did happen from the Creation to the coming of our Saviour; what the Flood was, what were the Egyptian and the Babiloniſh Captivities; what time <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> the Patriarchs and the Prophets lived in; what ſort of People the Heathens and the Jews were, and what kind of Life our Saviour led.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be ſaid that Hiſtory is above the Capacity of Children; for on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is that, which is to them the eaſieſt part of Religion, which they hearken to with the greateſt pleaſure, and which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member beſt. Nothing does more ſmoothly enter into their Minds than Hiſtory; all the things I have no mentioned may be taught them in a Week. And this Knowledge is as neceſſary as it is eaſily acquired. A Man can never underſtand his Religion well, or be thoroughly convinced of its Truth, if he does not know the Facts which is ſuppoſes. We ſee that it was by the Means of Hiſtory that God choſe to inſtruct Mankind, and that matters of Fact make up the moſt conſiderable part of the ſacred Writings. And therefore it is a ſtrange thing, that in Catechiſms and other Inſtructions given to Youth, Hiſtory ſhould be ſo little inſiſted upon. This is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly one of the Cauſes of that profound Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which the greateſt part of Chriſtians live in: This is the reaſon why they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand almoſt nothing of what they read or hear in Sermons, and why the Doctrines
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:96537:209"/>which they are taught make ſo little impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them.</p>
                  <p>Teaching Children Hiſtory, gives them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, ſome Notions of the Truths and Doctrines of Chriſtianity; but yet theſe Truths and Doctrines ought to be propoſed to them ſeparately, that they may have a more diſtinct apprehenſion of them. Above all things, great care ſhould be taken, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print upon the Minds of thoſe who are to be inſtructed, the knowledge and the belief of the Principles of Chriſtianity. But this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not done as it ſhould be. In Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, as well as in Sermons, particular Truths are dwelt upon, and the general ones are touched only by the by. This is a Fault I have obſerved in the very beginning of this Work.</p>
                  <p>Now at the ſame time that Children are ſuffered to be ignorant about many important Articles, they are perplexed with divers uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or not very neceſſary Inſtruction. Inſtead of limiting them to the eſſential parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, their Minds and Memories are filled up with many things which they may ſafely be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. Some would have them underſtand the Diſputes of Divines, concerning the moſt curious and abſtruſe Queſtions, and they are made to get ſeveral things by heart, which they do not underſtand, and which are of no great uſe. In the mean time Children learn theſe things and ſay them without Book, and being poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the conceit, that they are as many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, they rank among Divine Truths
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96537:210"/>School terms and Doctrines, of which they neither apprehend the Certainty nor the uſe. And thus having none but intricate Ideas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, they do not perceive the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Solidity or the Excellence of it, and they have neither true Love nor Reſpect for it.</p>
                  <p>When Children are once inſtructed in the Truths of Chriſtianity, it is particularly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acquaint them with the Duties of it. There are two diſtinct ſorts of duties in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt the Duties conceming Divine Worſhip or Service, and then the Duties of Morality. The Firſt are Adoration, the Honour which is paid to God, Prayer and Thanks-giving: But as theſe Duties may be performed either outwardly or in wardly, it is of very great moment to make Children apprehend, that Brayer and all the other Acts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought to proceed from the Heart, that<note n="*" place="bottom">John IV.</note> 
                     <hi>God will be ſerved in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> and that without this the Worſhip which is paid to him, either in private or in publick, does only provoke his Diſpleaſure. It is not enough therefore, to tell Children, that they muſt pray to God or go to Church, and to teach them ſome Form of Prayer, to be ſaid at certain Times and Hours: All this is but external, and if we go no farther, if we do not carefully inform them, that true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is Internal and Spiritual, we ſhall make but Hypocrites of them, by tenching them to pray and to perform Religious Acts. The Faults then which are committed in this
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96537:210"/>point, are of great Moment, and we may eaſily perceive, that Hypocriſy and Indevotion are the Conſequences of this Negligence. The Religion of moſt Chriſtians conſiſts only in ſome external Actions; they think they have fulfilled their Duty, when they have recited ſome Prayers, or been preſent at the Publick Worſhip of God, tho' in all they do this kind, they have neither Attention nor Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heart; but this Errour which is ſo capital, and yet ſo common, ariſes chiefly from hence, that Children are formed only to a meer outſide Devotion and Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Young People are not much better inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Moral Duties. I ſhall not enter here upon all the Conſideration which the Subject might afford, becauſe I have treated of the want of Inſtruction concerning Morals in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of this Treatiſe, and particularly in the 1 Chap. of the Firſt Part. Yet I muſt ſay that this Defect proceeds, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which are given to Youth. Much greater care is taken to inform them about the Doctrines than about the Duties of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Articles of the Creed, the Queſtions concerning the Sacraments, and the other Points of Doctrine, are handled and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined largely enough in Catechiſms, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is not forgot; but the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are explained in ſo ſuccinct and ſuperficial a manner, that we do not find there ſo much as the Names of a great many Vices, Virtues and Duties. Children who
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96537:211"/>ſhould be raiſed up to Chriſtian Perfection, are only taught the Ten Commandments, and from the Explication which is given of theſe, they gather that they ſhould not be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, Blaſphemers or profane Perſons; that they ſhould neither commit Murder nor Adultery, that they ſhould not ſteal or bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But how many other Duties are there of which they have no manner of Notion? They are not taught what it is to be Gentle, Humble; Sincere, Charitable, Pure, Sober and Patient. Many Perſons, becauſe they were never inſtructed in theſe Virtues which are the principal Ornaments of a Chriſtian, do not practiſe, or ſo much as know them. We are to impute to theſe ſlight and defective Inſtructions, that Opinion which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, That whoſoever is free from thoſe ſix or ſeven great ſins forbidden in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, is a good Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Succeſs of Inſtruction depends in the ſecond place upon the Method and way of Teaching. The Method of Teaching, ſhould on the one hand be clear and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the Age and Capacity of Children, and on the other, it ſhould be delightful, and fit to make them love Religion. By this, two Ends which ought to be aimed at, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the Mind will be enlightned, and the Heart moved. What is clear informeth the Mind, and what is delightful wins the Heart, and inſpires into it a ſtrong Affection for Religion and for the Duties of it.</p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:96537:211"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Perſpicuity is never more neceſſary, than it is in the Inſtructing of Youth. Children having no Ideas as yet of moſt things, and not being uſed to the ſignification of Words, cannot underſtand what is ſaid to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be delivered with much clearneſs and ſimplicity, and unleſs every thing be avoided, which may puzzle or ſeem obſcure to them. This Perſpicuity reſults Firſt, from the things that are taught. It is a certain Truth, is always clear and eaſie to be underſtood; and that on the contrary, Whatſoever is obſcure and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, is not very neceſſary. So that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Inſtruction goes no farther than eſſential Doctrines and Duties, it cannot be very hard for Children, to apprehend what is ſaid to them. Secondly, Clear Expreſſions, and plain and popular ways of ſpeaking, produce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ideas in the Minds of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; but a dark or too high a Stile, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative or learned Phraſes, ſpoil the Fruit of Inſtructions. Laſtly, Order and Method con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute mightily to Clearneſs. It is not fit that Children ſhould be loaded at firſt, with many Doctrines and Precepts. General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the Principles of Religion, and the ſimpleſt Ideas, ought to go foremoſt, and then particular Inſtructions and more complex Ideas, may be propoſed; but ſtill with a due Regard to the Age, Capacity, and Progreſs, of Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Inſtruction is to be delivered in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96537:212"/>manner. This is the way to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſelves into the Minds of Children. Nothing wins more upon them, than a ſweet and pleaſant way of ſpeaking, and nothing gives them ſo much diſguſt, as roughneſs and ſeverity. If Religion was repreſented to them with an attractive Aſpect, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly embrace it with eagerneſs. But for the moſt part thoſe who teach or ſpeak to them of Religion, do it with an Air of Severity, and a diſmal Tone, and with thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which make them averſe to it. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Threatnings, and Conſtraint are uſed, to make them take their Catechiſms or ſay their Prayers; if they fail to do this, their Teachers are angry and beat them. When we exhort them to Piety, in ſtead of going about this with ſuch a Gentleneſs as might make Virtue amiable to them, we ſpeak in a harſh and chiding manner. The Effect of this is, that Children ſeeing nothing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is inticing, take up a Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; they look upon that Inſtruction, to which they are compelled, as a hard piece of Labour and Drudgery. Religion is no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mentioned, but it damps their good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, they do nothing but by Conſtraint and againſt their Will; they free themſelves from that Conſtraint aſſoon as they can, and they bear during their whole Life an Averſion, or at leaſt, an Indifference to Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I have been diſcourſing hitherto, of what relates to the Knowledge of Religion,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96537:212"/>and I hope I have clearly proved, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, Children are ill inſtructed. I am now to conſider Education with relation to Practice. For it would be to no Purpoſe, to infuſe into young People, a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truths and Duties of Religion, if they were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> taught to make a good uſe of that Knowledge, and to direct it to its true End, which is the Practice of Virtue and Piety. But it is ſeldom that the Care of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and of thoſe who have the inſtructing of Children, goes ſo far. If they take ſome Care about their Inſtruction, they generally neglect them as to the practical Part, and they little enquire whether they live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Precepts of Religion. Now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions thus diſpenſed, do not only prove uſeleſs, but they may likewiſe make Children doubly wicked, and fill them with the moſt dangerous Prejudices. When Children ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Religion is propoſed to them only, in an Hiſtorical and Speculative Manner, and that provided they remember what is told them, and are able to give an Account of it, they are commended for being well skilled in Religion; and that as for the reſt, they are permitted to live as they pleaſe, and that they are not chid, tho' they do not practiſe what they were taught; they conclude from all this, that Religion conſiſts wholly, in the Knowledge and Profeſſion of certain Truths, and that it is not abſolutely neceſſary to frame their Lives according to the Rules of the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:96537:213"/>Goſpel. They accuſtom themſelves beſides to ſlight their Knowledge, and to act againſt the Principles of their own Conſciences. Theſe pernicious Sentiments are infuſed into Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when Inſtructions are not directed to Practice. To prevent ſo great an Evil, theſe Rules are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Deſign of propoſing the Truths and Doctrines of Chriſtianity to Children, ſhould be to beget in them a love and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for them; and in order to that, we ſhould let them ſee, their Certainty, their Importance, and their Uſe. It ought then to be carefully inculcated to them, that there is nothing more true and certain, nothing of greater Importance, or that concerns us nearer than Religion, and that in Compariſon with it, all that we ſee in the World, is of very little or no Conſequence; and laſtly, that it was revealed for no other End, but to make us good, and to conduct us to the higheſt Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. By this Method, Inſtruction will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways terminate in Practice. By teaching Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to know God, we ſhall excite in them a Love and Reverence towards that Supreme Being. By ſpeaking to them of Providence, we ſhall make them apprehend that God ſees every thing, and what Reaſons we have to depend upon, and to fear him. By telling them the Hiſtory of the Bible, we ſhall make them obſerve in thoſe various Events, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of God's Wiſdom, of his Goodneſs Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juſtice. In explaining to them the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:96537:213"/>of the Sacraments, we ſhall chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to make them underſtand, what theſe ſacred Ceremonies oblige Chriſtians to, what an Auguſt and Venerable thing Baptiſm is, and what Purity is required in thoſe who are baptized: And ſo when we ſpeak to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſt and his Sufferings, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and a future Judgment, of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Rewards of another Life, and of all the other Truths, we ſhould do it in ſuch a manner, as may ſtir them up to Piety and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the next place we ought to engage Children to the Practice and Obſervation of the Duties of Chriſtianity, with relation both to Worſhip and Manners. And firſt it is altogether neceſſary, to teach them to render to God the Worſhip that is due to him. There are few Chriſtian Families, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is not done with this Intention. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are made to learn ſome Prayers, to ſay them Mornings and Evenings, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the publick and private Exerciſes of Piety. But the main ſhould be, to bring them to ſincerity in Divine-Service, leſt they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Impiety and Hypocriſy. The greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ſhould be, to accuſtom them to Pray with Attention and Reverence. This may at firſt ſeem difficult; we neither ſee the Heart of Children, nor can regulate the motions of it. But yet I think, there are ways to fix their Minds, which might be ſucceſsfully uſed: And I hope my Readers will not think it amiſs
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96537:214"/>if I dwell a little upon this Head, conſidering the importance of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I Would not have Children Pray, before they have ſome knowledge of what they are doing. There is a Cuſtom eſtabliſhed every where, which I look upon as the firſt Cauſe of Indevotion; and that is, to make little Children recite Prayers, and long ones too. I do not apprehend the uſe of this, nor where the inconvenience would be, if Children did not Pray at an Age when they can hardly ſpeak an articulate Word. It would be time enough to make them Pray, when they are capable of ſome Reflection. If we did wait till then, they might Pray with Attention; and, I make no doubt, but they would do it with Pleaſure and Reverence. Children think it an Honour to do what is done by Men; if therefore they were not permitted to Pray till they came to a certain Age, they would look upon Praying as a particular Priviledge. But when they are made to Pray before they have any ſenſe of what they do, it put this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into their Heads, that Praying in nothing elſe but reciting of Prayers: And beſides, that Obligation which is laid upon them, to perform regularly a Duty, of which they do not yet underſtand the Neceſſity or the Uſe, makes that they only obſerve it out of Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I could wiſh that when we begin to make Children Pray, we ſhould Teach them plain and ſhort Prayers, wherein they might ſay nothing but what they underſtood. Two
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:96537:214"/>or Three Sentences are enough in thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and as they grow in Years, longer Prayers may be preſcribed them. Brevity is to every Body a help to Devotion; but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being not capable of a long attention, it is certain, that long Prayers are not at all fit for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It would be very uſeful to Diſcourſe with them about the Excellency and the Neceſſity of Prayer, and to make them apprehend what an Honour it is for us, to ſpeak to God, and to lay open our Neceſſities before him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In order to accuſtom Children, to look upon Prayer with Reverence, and to go about it with Seriouſneſs; they ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to Pray when they are ſtrongly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeffed with ſome Paſſion, or Object, or when they have committed a conſiderable Fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Piety.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is particularly neceſſary to regulate and obſerve their behaviour and looks, while they are at Prayers, and then likewiſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Reverence our ſelves, and to ſay or do nothing that may give them any diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is a Cuſtom as bad, as it is ordinary in Families, to go to and fro, to be buſy and to talk, all the while that Children are ſaying their Prayers. How is it poſſible that amidſt all that noiſe, which would even hinder old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er People to Pray as they ought, Children, whoſe Thoughts are ſo rambling, ſhould not be diſtracted? And what Reverence can be expected from them about the Exerciſes of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96537:215"/>Piety when their Fathers and Mothers who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſhew none at all? This is what I have to obſerve, concerning Prayer, which is the principal part of Divine Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the Duties of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, very particular care ought to be taken, to make Children obſerve them. The firſt mean to be uſed next to Inſtruction, is to exhort them to the Practice of Virtue, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them, that Piety and Holineſs are the eſſential Characters of a Chriſtian. But the Exhortations directed to them will have no great effect, if they are not diſpenſed with Prudence. Sometimes Parents ſpoil all, tho' they mean well. They Exhort and Chide at every turn, they are perpetually Admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Moralizing, by this they give a diſguſt to their Children, inſtead of winning upon them. Exhortations ought to be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Diſcretion and Gentleneſs; above all, we ſhould endeavour to perſuade and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon Children by Reaſon, that ſo being convinced in their own Hearts of the Juſtice Beauty and Uſefulneſs of Virtue, they might practiſe it of their own accord, out of Inclination and with Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>That we may be able to Exhort Children as is fitting, it is requiſite to be well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Temper, and to obſerve which are their predominant Inclinations; that if thoſe Inclinations are good, they may be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and if bad, corrected. And it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to know the Temper of Children, becauſe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96537:215"/>they deal ingenuouſly, and have not yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Art of Diſſembling. If Men did make this their Study, if they did take hold of the good Diſpoſition which may be in Children, if they did apply themſelves to oppoſe the predominant Faults, to which either their Age or their Conſtitution inclines them; they would preſerve them from many Vices, and make them great Proficients in Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, Parents either by themſelves or others, ought to watch over the Conduct of their Children, and to enquire ſtrictly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they practiſe the Leſſons which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, whether they are afraid of doing ill things, whether they forbear thoſe Faults for which they have been reproved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they reſiſt their vicious inclinations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are gentle, ſober, humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, in their Diſcourſes, Actions, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. To this End it is very proper, that they ſhould not have too much liberty, and that they ſhould be for the moſt part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eye of ſome Wiſe Perſons who may obſerve their Deportment. I do not enlarge upon theſe Conſiderations, becauſe they would carry me too far; neither do I ſpeak here of Encouragement, Correction, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, nor of ſome other Means which might be very uſefully taken in hand for regulating the Conduct of Children, becauſe theſe have been ſpoken to already.</p>
                  <p>There is ground enough to conclude from what has been ſaid, that Corruption proceeds
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96537:216"/>primarily and chiefly from the ill Education of Youth. The ordinary Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being not Chriſtian, what wonder is it, that true Chriſtianity and folid Virtue ſhould be ſo ſcarce? The firſt Impreſſions are the ſtrongeſt. The Principles which have been imbibed in the firſt Years of Life, do not wear out afterwards; and thoſe who had not a good Education, are not often known to be wiſe and regular in their Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Let it not be objected here, what many are wont to alledge upon this Subject, That the Errors of Education are not ſo conſiderable, but that they may be corrected afterwards, and that Wiſdom comes with Years. Thus thoſe Men reaſon who only examine things ſuperficially; but ſuch Perſons did never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reflect upon Man's Temper, upon the manner how ill Habits are formed, or upon Experience. Almoſt all good or ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits begin in Infancy, and they grow ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er afterwards. The Age which ſucceeds Youth is ſo far from ſupplying the Defects of Education, that on the contrary, the longer a Man lives, the more difficult it is for him to return to Virtue, if he did not ſet out well at firſt. For beſides, that Habits are then ſtronger and deeper rooted, Buſineſs does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo come with Age, and People have no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that leiſure and freedom, which they had when they were young. Thoſe therefore who do not take right Meaſures early, and who lanch into the World with ill Principles, are
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:96537:216"/>ſtill growing worſe inſtead of amending. This is verified by daily experience. Age ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alters Men for the better.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny, but that People who were neglected in their Infancy, or whoſe Youth has been unruly, are ſometimes known to change their Manners and their Conduct, when they come to a riper Age. But we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how this Change happens, and what the Nature of it is. In ſome it is a thorough Change, and a ſincere return to Virtue. God ſometimes works Converſion in the greateſt Sinners; and he does this commonly by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Sickneſſes and Pains. But ſuch kinds of Converſion are not very frequent. The Change which we think we obſerve both in our ſelves and others, is not always ſincere; it is often no more than an effect of Age, of the State we are in, or of Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>Age does Two Things, it deadens the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and it changes them. In the heat of Youth Paſſions are violent, and make a great ſtir; when the prime of Life is over, a Man perhaps is no longer a Libertine or a Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhee; but his Exterior only is reformed. The ſame Principle of Corruption remains in his Heart. He that was Senſual and given to Lewdneſs, moderates himſelf; but ſtill his Heart and his Imaginations are defiled. He that was Profane and Impious, does no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er profeſs Libertiniſm openly, he practiſes ſome Duties of Religion. But for all that, he has no more Devotion, or Faith than before.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:96537:217"/>Age does likewiſe change Mens Paſſions and Inclinations. Young People have their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſuppoſing theſe ſhould abate about Forty or Fifty, or even that they ſhould be quite left off, which yet happens but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; there are other Paſſions which ſucceed thoſe of Youth, and which work the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe they are not ſo much miſtruſted, and becauſe they make leſs noiſe, and are hid under the pretence of a Lawful Calling. Thus we ſee often that Libertines and Deboſhees, end with Ambition and Covetouſneſs. The World calls the Change which is obſerved in thoſe Men, Converſion and Amendment. A Man is ſaid to be reclaimed from the Errors of his younger Days, when his Conduct is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Scandalous, or manifeſtly Criminal; but if he is free from the Faults of his Youth, he is guilty of others, which he had not then. He is no longer Diſſolute, but he is a Slave to Ambition, he is Covetous, Unjuſt, and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the World, more than ever. Nay, all things well conſidered, he is worſe than he was in his youth; ſince he has run from one Vice into another, and loaded himſelf with the Sins of the ſeveral Stages of Life. We are not to imagine, that every alteration which Age makes in Mens Conduct and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is a true Converſion.</p>
                  <p>The various States, Callings, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Men do likewiſe put many of them upon altering their way of Living, and make
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:96537:217"/>them give over thoſe Exceſſes to which they have been addicted for ſome time. As ſoon as a Man come to be the Maſter of a Family, or to be preferred to Places, he muſt of heceſſity grow more regular in his Conduct, and forſake ſeveral Diſorders which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd that the chief reaſon why Men live ill, is becauſe they have not been well Educated.</p>
                  <p>I do not think it neceſſary to mention the Remedies of this Cauſe of Corruption: I have
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96537:218"/>obſerved them all along, in ſhewing the Faults which are committed in the Education of Youth: I ſhall only add, before I diſmiſs the Subject, that all this does properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Maſters of Families and Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>It were therefore to be wiſhed, in the firſt place, that Parents would take more Care than they do, to Breed their Children well, and that in this, they would proceed by the Rules which Reaſon and Religion preſcribe. They are miſtaken if they think they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves from this Obligation, which both Nature and Piety lay upon them, and which cannot be neglected without a Sin. But the Careleſneſs of Parents in this Point, may very juſtly be wondered at; the Education of their Children is generally that of all things, which they mind the leaſt, and the reaſon of it is, that they themſelves want Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>It would be requiſite in the next place, that Paſtors ſhould diſcharge their Duty with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to young People, and that to this end in all Places and Churches, the neceſſary Order and Method were eſtabliſhed for inſtructing the People and particularly Children. I remark this, becauſe in this reſpect things are not well ordered, ſo that in many Places ſuch helps andmeans are very much wanting. It is well known, that the opportunities of Inſtruction and the helps to Piety are mighty ſcarce in the Country and in Villages. Schools are there managed at a very ordinary rate, and many
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96537:218"/>Places have no School at all, whereby it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that many Perſons cannot ſo much as read. There likewiſe, Divine Service is but ſeldom performed, and very careleſly too. The Miniſters who are appointed in thoſe Places, are generally either Men of little worth, or Men who do not watch over their Flocks as they ought, and who are remiſs in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Office. Theſe are the eſſential Defects which ſhould be remedied, by thoſe who have Authority in Church or State.</p>
                  <p>Above all, it is requiſite that Church-Men ſhould have a ſtrict inſpection over Schools and Families, and that Catechiſings were more frequent than they are. Young People ought to be the chief objects of the care of Paſtors; no part of their Office is more uſeful, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Labours with better ſucceſs than that. Their endeavours to mend thoſe who are come to Age, are for the moſt part to little purpoſe, but what they do for Children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of great benefit. If therefore they have a Zeal for the Glory of God, and if they wiſh to ſee a change in the face of the Church, let them apply themſelves to the inſtructing of youth, and make it their Buſineſs to form a New Gneration.</p>
                  <p>Among the particular Eſtabliſhments which might be made, for the edification of the Church and the benefit of young People, there is one which would be of great uſe, and which ſeems to me abſolutely neceſſary. And that is that with relation to Children, who have
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:96537:219"/>attained the Age of diſcretion, the ſame order ſhould be obſerved for their admiſſion to the Sacrament, which was practiſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, when Catechumens were to be received into the Church by Baptiſm. This admiſſion was very ſolemn. A long Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſtruction went before it. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens were required to give an account of their Faith, and the bound themſelves by ſolemn Promiſes and Vows, to renounce the World and to live Holy. No ſuch thing is done at this day in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, becauſe young Children are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; but what is not done at the time of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſhould be done when they come to Years of diſcretion. And truly if there be not a publick and ſolemn Profeſſion, a Promiſe in due form on the Children's part, I do not ſee how we can well anſwer what is objected by ſome againſt Infant-Baptiſm, which yet is a good and laudable Practice. A Man cannot be obliged to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will or without his knowledge, This engagement is a perſonal thing, is which every bold ſhould act and anſwer for himſelf. When Children are baptized, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is done to them; it is there fore abſolutely neceſſary that when they come to the years of Reaſon, they ſhould ratify and confirm, the Engagements they came under by their Baptiſm, and that they ſhould become Members of the Church out of Knowledge and Choice. Now the fitteſt time for ſuch a
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:96537:219"/>Confirmation and Promiſe, is when they are admitted to the participation of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>The Order then which I mean is this: Firſt that when Children deſire to be admitted to the Sacrament, they ſhould be inſtructed for ſome Weeks before, and that at the ſame time they ſhould be informed of the Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and importance of this Action, and of the Promiſe they are to make, that ſo they might prepare for it betimes. In the next Place, that they ſhould be examined, and that they ſhould publickly render an account of their Faith. This Examination being over, that they ſhould be required, to renew and confirm in a publick and ſolemn Manner their Baptiſmal Vow, to renounce the Devil and his Works, the World and the Pomp of it, the Fleſh and its Luſts, and to promiſe that they will live and die in the Chriſtian Faith: And then that they ſhould be admitted to the Communion by Benediction and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>It will, no doubt, ſeem to ſome, that I am here propoſing a Novelty, and that too not very neceſſary; that there is no occaſion for all this Solemnity; that it is enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and exhort Children in private, and that this Confirmation of the Baptiſmal Vow is included and ſuppoſed in the admiſſion to the Sacrament. To this I ſay, that the order I propoſe will be thought a Novelty by none but ſuch as do not know what was anciently
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:96537:220"/>practiſed, and who call Innovation every thing, which does not agree with the Cuſtom of their Country or their Church. This is an imitation of the Ancient and the Apoſtolical Order; and beſides, this Eſtabliſhment being altogether ſutable to the Nature of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as I have juſt now made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it ought not to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>As for what is ſaid, that it is ſufficient if Children are examined and admitted in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: I anſwer, that the Corruption of the Age we live in is ſo great, that in many Churches this Admiſſion, and the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which precedes it, is but three or four hours Work, and ſometimes leſs. Paſtors and thoſe to whom this Function is committed, do often go about it very negligently, they content themſelves with ſome Queſtions, which for the moſt part relate only to Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Controverſy; the addreſs to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren general exhortations to Piety, but they take no care to inſtruct them in Morals, or to examine their Conduct; they do not require of them an expreſs Ratification of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Vow. I know there are Paſtors who do their Duty, but the beſt thing would be, to have this Form of Examination and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion regulated in ſuch a manner, that it might not be in the Breaſt of every Miniſter to do in this Matter as he thinks fit. And that all this might be done the more orderly, it would be fitting, that according to the Practice of the Primitive Church, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:96537:220"/>ſhould be appointed on Purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Young People and Catechumens. What Care ſoever may be taken of Children, and whatever may be done for them in private Inſtructions, it is certain that publick and ſolemn Exhortations on the one hand, and Promiſes on the other, would make a much greater Impreſſion upon them. They would then look upon their Admiſſion with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they would remember it all their Lives, and this Solemnity would prove as uſeful and edifying to the whole Church as it would be to young People. I offer this with the greater Confidence, becauſe an Order like this has been ſetled of late in ſome Churches, and is there obſerved with extraordinary Succeſs.</p>

               <div n="6" type="cause">
                  <head>CAUSE VI. Example and Cuſtom.</head>
                  <p>THere is no doubt to be made, but that Birth, Education, and Imitation, are three general Principles of the Irregularities of Mons Conduct. The State in which they are born gives them a Byaſs towards Vice. Education, as has been ſhewn in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, cheriſhes, and maintains in moſt Men that vicious Inclination: But Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Example give the finiſhing Stroke to Mens Corruption, and make Vice reign in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:96537:221"/>the World with a Sovereign Sway. This Third Principle is ſo general and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that ſome have thought it the chief Cauſe of Corruption, and that we cannot better explain how Sin is propagated and tranſmitted from the Parents to the Children, than by ſaying that this happens through Imitation. And indeed it cannot be denied but that Men are particularly drawn into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by Example and Cuſtom. If this be not the primary or the only Spring of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is at leaſt one of the principal Sources of it. And therefore I thought it proper to conſider this Matter here with ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>All that I am to ſay in this Chapter is founded upon theſe two Suppoſitions. 1. I ſuppoſe that Men love to act by Imitation, and that Example is one of thoſe things which have the greateſt Force upon their Minds. But when the Example is general, and ſupported by Cuſtom and Multitude, they are yet more inclined to follow it. They not only conform to Cuſtom, but they think it beſides juſt and lawful to do ſo. General Uſe is to them inſtead of Law, by which they judge of what is innocent and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And that which doth yet more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly determine them to follow Example and the greater Numbers, is that they think it a Diſgrace to do otherwiſe. So that the Fear of Contempt added to their Inclination makes them perfect Slaves to Cuſtom. If ſome Remnant of Knowledge and Conſcience does
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:96537:221"/>not ſuffer them to imagine that there is no Hurt in complying in all things with Cuſtom, however they comfort themſelves with the Thought that the Evil they do is not very great, and that if they are not innocent, they are excuſable at leaſt, when they can plead Example and common Practice in their own Behalf.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe <hi>2ly.</hi> That Example and Cuſtom are bad for the moſt part. This I think needs not be proved; and if it did, this whole Treatiſe might afford us ſufficient Proofs of it, ſince Ignorance, Prejudices, falſe Maxims and all the other Cauſes of Corruption I have mentioned, are ſo many Diſpoſitions, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practices, which are grown Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary, and are eſtabliſhed by the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Uſe.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſo needful to prove that the Multitude of ill Examples is very great, and that Cuſtom is generally vicious, as it is to ſhew that under the Shelter of Example and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Corruption is ſtill ſpreading farther in the World and in the Church.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, I ſhall conſider the Power of Cuſtom and Example, in theſe three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. With relation, 1. To Matters of Faith. <hi>2ly.</hi> To the Order of the Church. And, <hi>3ly.</hi> To Manners. What I am to ſay upon theſe three Heads will diſcover the Source of thoſe three great Imperfections which are obſerved in the Chriſtian Church, I mean Error, want of Order, and the bad Life of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:96537:222"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Matters of Faith ſhould not be ſubjected to the Tyranny of Cuſtom. Religion does not depend upon Mens Fancies and Opinions: The Truths of it are eternal Truths, it is founded upon an immutable Principle, and it is not more liable to change than God who is the Author of it. And yet we ſee but too frequently, that in Religion as well as in worldy Affairs, Example is more prevalent than either Reaſon Juſtice or Truth. Men do ſcarce ever examine things in their own Nature, but Cuſtom is the Rule of their Faith and Sentiments; by this Rule the determine what is true of falſe, what they are to believe or to reject. And this Prejudice is ſo ſtrong and Men have carried it ſo far, that Multitude and Cuſtom, are looked upon as a Proof and Character whereby Chriſtians are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Truth from Error, and to judge what ſide they are to Chuſe in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>What is the Reaſon why ſo many People do not perceive, that certain Doctrine are palpable Errors, and Monſtrous Tenets? We wonder how it is poſſible in ſo learned and refined an Age as this is, that the groſſeſt Fables and Extravagances ſhould ſtill go down with Men of Parts, for Divine Truths and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Myſteries. A Time will come, when Poſterity will hardly believe, that ever ſuch Opinions were received, or that ever Men did in earneſt diſpute for or againſt ſuch or ſuch a Tenet. It is only the Prejudice of Example and Multitude, which do blind Men
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:96537:222"/>at this day: They have been nurs'd up and Educated in thoſe Perſuaſions, they ſee them obtaining among Numerous Societies, and that is the occaſion of their Obſtinacy in Error.</p>
                  <p>Nothing but this Inclination of Men to follow Cuſtom, keeps up in the Church thoſe Diſputes which rend it into ſo many different Sects. The Principle and Deſign of moſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes is no other, but that Men will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at any rate, the Sentiments of their Party; and by this means thoſe who are in Error, inſtead of being undeceived, are more and more Confirmed in it. Every body ſwallows without Chewing, all that is profeſt in the Society or Communion in which he lives, and Condemns without Examination the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are maintained by ſmall Numbers, or by Perſons of another Country or Society. Thoſe who are prepoſſeſſed do not ſo much as make it a Queſtion, whether they may not be miſtaken, and whether the Truth may not be on the other ſide. It is to no purpoſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to ſuch People the moſt invincible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to preſs them with expreſs Declarations of Scripture, or with un anſwerable Objections; for either they do not attend to all this, or if they Examine thoſe Reaſons and Objections, it is with a Mind full of Prejudices, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before-hand to think them frivolous, and not to alter their Sentiments. They ſatisfy themſelves with ſome ſorry Argument, or wretched Anſwer. If any Scruples and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remain, they ſhake them off in a trice, and ſet
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:96537:223"/>their Conſcience at reſt, with this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they follow the common Opinion; they make no do doubt but that they are ſafe, as long as they ſide with the greater Number. Beſides, the Advantages of the World which may be obtained by the adhering to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion, would fully determine them, if they were not determined before, and they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſuade themſelves, that their Spiritual Welfare and the Truth are to be found in that Party, which agrees beſt with their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Cuſtom is likewiſe, the chief Obſtacle to the reſtoring of Order in the Church. I could here make a long Article, if I would mention all the Defects, which may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the State of the Church and of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with relation to Order. But having done this already in the beginning of this Second Part, I ſhall only ſay in general, that nothing contributes ſo much to the maintaining of Diſorder as Cuſtom does. The moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws and Inſtitutions are looked upon as dangerous Innovations, when they are not Authorized by Practice: Men dare not ſo much as attempt to introduce them. On the other hand, uſeleſs or ill Practices, are thought Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Eſtabliſhments, as ſoon as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Time and Cuſtom. If Men do but endeavour to lay aſide ſome Ceremony, to make ſome alteration in a Liturgy, or in the Form of Divine-Services; It ſeems to many, that the very eſſence of Religion is ſtruck at.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:96537:223"/>Thus it happens that Abuſes which are palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and acknowledge by all Men of Senſe, ſubſiſt for whole Ages and cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty of reviving the Apoſtolical Diſcipline, and of reſtoring Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Miniſtry of Paſtors, to the State they ought to be in, proceeds from the ſame Cauſe. Becauſe a certain Form of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government and Diſcipline, obtains in a Country, it is pretended to be the beſt and moſt perfect, in which nothing is to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe are not ſo much as heard, who propoſe the eſtabliſhing of another. If any one thinks it a Fault to ſuffer Scandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Boſom of the Church, if he thinks that they ought to be Excommunicated, and that Chriſtians ought to maintain no familiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with them; tho' ſuch a Man has the Laws of the Apoſtles on his ſide, yet he ſhall be called an Innovator. Tho' he ſhould plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the Inconveniences of the ordinary Practice, and the neceſſity of Diſcipline, from Scripture, from the Pattern of the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Ages, and by the moſt convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet Cuſtom will ſtill be urged againſt him; the Divine Laws ſhall give place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſage, and the preſent Practice ſhall prevail above that of the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Example and Cuſtom have a great force, eſpecially in thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Manners. Men are not altogether ſuch Slaves to Cuſtom in Matters of Opinion about
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:96537:224"/>Religion, becauſe Opinions are ſhut up within the Heart, but in Practical Things and in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, there are few Men who are not carried away by the Stream of the Multitude. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think themſelves excuſed from the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the plaineſt and the moſt Sacred Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as ſoon as they cannot obſerve them without departing from Cuſtom, and ſo, they conform to the common Uſe how bad ſoever it may be. Thoſe who Condemn the vicious and corrupt Manners of the Age, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Rules of the Goſpel, who for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance abſtain from Swearing, and reprove thoſe who do it, who make ſcruple of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of tranſgreſſing the Rules of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; are looked upon in the World as Homour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome People, and ſtigmatized with Odious Names and Imputations. If they plead the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; inſtead of giving up the Cauſe, Men will ſtrain the Scripture, and by force Explications and impious Gloſſes, endeavour to fix a Senſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it which may favour the ordinary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. While Piety dares not ſhew it ſelf, Vice is reſpected and bad Men carry it boldly every where, becauſe the Numbers are of their ſide. Maxims directly oppoſite to the Moral Precepts of our Saviour, are not only received and tolerated, but they are defended as innocent for this ſingle Reaſons, That the generality of Men approve and practiſe them. This might be confirmed by innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:96537:224"/>
                  <p>We can hardly imagine any thing more contrary to the Precepts of the Goſpel, than that worldly Life which is led by many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. They ſpend their whole time in the Cares of the Body, they wear out their Lives in Idleneſs, Gaming, Pleaſures and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they deny themſelves nothing, they make it their ſtudy to live Luxuriouſly and to gratify themſelves. This kind of Life is inconſiſtent with Piety, but becauſe it obtains among Perſons of the higher Rank, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to perſuade thoſe who follow it, that they ought to quit it. It is by alledging com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice, that Men defend a ſoft and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Life, Faſhions contrary to Chaſtity and Modeſty, the too great familiarity of the Young Perſons of both Sexes, the reading of ill Books, the Plays which would Honeſty and Religion, ſcandalous Diverſions, and thoſe Aſſemblies where the moſt inticing baits and allurements to Vice are to be met with, and where the Minds of Young People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt dangerous Impreſſions: All theſe Things, I ſay, are defended by Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>So that when Luxury, and expenſiveneſs and ſtate in Apparel, Eating, or Furniture, are once eſtabliſhed; we endeavour to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bring Men to Chriſtian Moderation, and to baniſh that multitude of Scandals and Vices, which muſt needs attend ſuch kind of Exceſſes. Thus in ſome Nations where Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſs is in Vogue, it is in vain to oppoſe ſo vicious a Cuſtom. In ſpight of all that can
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:96537:225"/>be ſaid againſt Drunkenneſs and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, People are ſo far from parting with that Vice, that they fancy there is no ſin in being Drunk.</p>
                  <p>To put up no Injuries, to indulge Revenge, to be tender and nice upon the Point of falſe Honour, to ſtick at nothing that can promote one's Fortune, to aſſume all Shapes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe one's Sentiments, and to ſupplant others: All theſe are Maxims which are followed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple, becauſe they are authorized by Uſe, and by the falſe Opinions of Men. It would ſignifie nothing to alledge to thoſe who are poſſeſſed with ſuch Sentiments, what the Goſpel enjoins us concerning Patience, forgiving of Injuries, Humility, Sincerity, Juſtice and Charity; ſuch Morals will not be ſo much as hearkened to, becauſe theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are otherwiſe determined by Cuſtom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the ſame reaſon it it pretended, that in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, in Trade, in Arts and in the various Profeſſions of Life; every thing which is uſually practiſed by Men in thoſe ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, may Lawfully be done. Nay, even an Oath is not ſufficient to undeceive People; moſt Men explain their Oaths and regulate their Conſciences by the Example of others; they uſe all the Methods of Gain which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom has introduced, without enquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are juſtifiable or not.</p>
                  <p>When I ſpeak here of Cuſtom and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I do not only mean that which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by general Uſe, but that likewiſe
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:96537:225"/>which is authorized by Men in Credit. The Quality of Perſons produces the ſame effect that great Numbers do; one ſingle Example has ſometimes as much force, as the united Examples of a Multitude. All that is done and approved of by Princes, great Men, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Perſons of Quality, is a Law to a great many People. A ſmall Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſons, who join their endeavours to bring a Practice into faſhion, is enough to make it in a little time to be generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, how bad ſoever it may be. This is ſo commonly ſeen, that I think it needleſs to give Inſtances of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add Three Conſiderations, which deſerve a very particular Attention; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touched them by the by, but I will propoſe them more diſtinctly here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That common Opinion, That it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to embrace the Sentiments and the Ways of Living which are received in the World, is that which makes Corruption ſpread and inſinuate it ſelf every where. Men make it a Law to themſelves, and repute it honourable to comply with Cuſtom. It is laid down for a Maxim, That we muſt live as other do, and accommodate our ſelves to the Faſhions which are eſtabliſhed, and that it would make us ridiculous, if in Behaviour and Manners we ſhould differ from the Age and the Place we live in. I do not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject this Maxim, becauſe it is capable of a very good Senſe. A Chriſtian ſhould not
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:96537:226"/>profeſs an unſociable Piety: He may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve certain Decences, and comply to a certain degree with the Opinions and Manners of thoſe he converſes with; nay, he ought to do this for the Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety. But ſuch a Compliance and ſuch regards become Criminal, when they engage him to act againſt Duty and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If the Cuſtom be bad, he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, and to do in ſpite of it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God commands; he does not deſerve the Name of a Chriſtian, who has not the Courage to do this.</p>
                  <p>And yet few People are capable of this Reſolution, the greateſt part is overcome by the temptation of the Multitude; the regard they bear to the Example and Judgment of others, produces in them a falſe ſhame which hinders them from doing their Duty, and prompts them to Evil notwithſtanding all the checks of Conſcience. And nothing is ſo fatal and pernicious in the ſtate of thoſe who thus comply with Cuſtom, as that they become ſuch habitual Slaves to it, that they are no more able to alter their conduct. When a Man is once got into a certain Courſe of Life in the World, he purſues it, and he is ſtill engaging deeper into it, till at laſt he comes under a kind of impoſſibility of leaving it tho' he would; becauſe in order to that, he muſt break off thoſe Ties and Engagements, which he has been contracting for a great while; he muſt withdraw from divers Companies, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:96537:226"/>enter quite upon another way of living; now it is very ſeldom, if ever, that People can reſolve upon all this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even thoſe Perſons who are well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, are ſhaken by Example and Cuſtom: I ſaid ſomething of this in the Chapter of Falſe-ſhame. A great many are ſatisfied, that the ſide of the Multitude is not the beſt, and that the Manners of the Age do not agree with Religion; but they dare not ſwerve from Cuſtome, the fear of being hated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, or deſpiſed, reſtrains them, and frequently extorts ſinful Compliances from them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take notice to this purpoſe of what happens every Day to Young People, whom Parents have endeavoured to breed up to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and good Manners. When they firſt go out of their Father's Houſe, they are aſhamed and afraid of doing ill things, Sin raiſes ſome kind of horror in them. With theſe Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions they lanch into the World, they are placed either in the Army or at Court. And there they do not find thoſe Maxims of Piety practiſed which have been infuſed into them, but they have only ill examples before their Eyes. They ſee there Perſons who have been recommended to them for behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon whom their promotion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes depend, and who are reputed honeſt Men; they ſee ſuch Perſons I ſay living in a licentious manner. This at firſt ſurprizes and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:96537:227"/>troubles them, their Conſcience holds out for a while, but example does inſenſibly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in them the Aborrence of Vice, their good Diſpoſitions vaniſh in a little time, and at laſt they ſwim with the Stream, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden themſelves in ill things, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come finiſhed Libertines. They do in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner drink in the Atheiſtical Sentiments, which commonly are in faſhion among Perſons of Quality. If they are but told that Men of Wit and Quality do not believe a thing, or, that they entertain any Opinion, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them embrace that Opinion, and queſtion the Truths of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the laſt place Men are apt to think that if Cuſtom does not juſtify, it does at leaſt excuſe Vice, and that if they do amiſs in the following the general practice, it is but a ſin of Infirmity which God will not take notice of. This is the laſt refuge of a great many Perſons; they will own that Mens Manners are very much depraved, and that there is little of true Piety among them, but they will ſay; this is the faſhion now a-days, this is the way of the World, and he cannot be very guilty, who does only what others do. Nay ſeveral Men who are not Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and who ſee what ſhould be done for the good of the Church, and the promoting of Piety, fancy themſelves under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to oppoſe Cuſtom. Their excuſe is, that it ſignifies nothing to ſtrive againſt a torrent. So that ſloth and timorouſneſs together; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:96537:227"/>the difficulties which their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repreſents to them, they make no efforts, and they let things go on at the uſual rate. While Cuſtom corrupts and blinds ſome, it intimidates and diſcourages others; and thus Vice and Diſorder are ſtill taking deeper roots.</p>
                  <p>Now two ſorts of Remedies may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Cauſe of Corruption, to wit particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and general Remedies.</p>
                  <p>The particular Remedies are thoſe cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which every body ought to uſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his being ſeduced by Example and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. There are Two principal means for a Man to keep himſelf free from this Seduction; the firſt is to avoid ill Examples as much as poſſible, to withdraw from thoſe Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to abſtain from thoſe Imployments which draw Men into Sin, and to chuſe a kind of Life which may not engage us too far into the World; and on the contrary to ſeek after good examples, and to be converſant with virtuous Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Part. I. Cauſe. III. Artic. II. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cauſe V. Art. II, about the end.</note> But as notwithſtanding all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpections, we cannot avoid being often tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ill Example. ſo we ought in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place to arm and fortifie our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Temptation; by ſtrongly poſſeſſing our Minds with the Sentiments which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſpires. I have ſhewed elſewhere, what
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:96537:228"/>Judgement a Chriſtian ought to make of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Men's Opinion. It is evident, that God having ſet us a Law, by which he will judge us, and having give us the knowledge of that Law, and powerful Encouragements to make it the Rule of our deportment; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Example nor the Judgement of the World, can any ways excuſe us from doing what God commands, or deliver us from the Puniſhment which our Diſobedience deſerves. Thoſe who have a greater Regard to Cuſtom than to their Duty, are ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable; becauſe the Goſpel expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us, to govern our ſelves by the Practice or Example of the Men of the World. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Chriſtians<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. XII. Eph. II, and IV. Tit. II. Mat. VII. XIII. XIV</note> 
                     <hi>Not to be conformed to this preſent world, not to walk after the courſe of this world, not to follow other mens way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; to renounce the world and the luſts of it.</hi> Our Saviour enjoins his Diſciples, <hi>To avoid the wide gate and the broad way of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and to ſtrike into <hi>The narrow path which is walked in but by a few.</hi> Theſe are Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which every Man who believes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, would frequently and ſeriouſly make, and which ſhould ſerve him for Remedies againſt the Temptations ariſing from Example and Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>There are other general Remedies, which tend to leſſen the number of bad Examples,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:96537:228"/>and to alter the Cuſtoms and Uſages which are contrary to the Chriſtian Religion. For tho' it may ſeem, that to go about the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is eſtabliſhed, by a general Cuſtom and a long Uſe, is to attempt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility; and tho' we cannot expect that this Cauſe of Corruption ſhould be intirely removed, yet the difficulty is not ſo great, but that it might in ſome meaſure be overcome.</p>
                  <p>This we might have Reaſon to hope for, if Firſt, thoſe who know and love their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would diſcharge it with Courage, and if they did add to their Knowledge a Zeal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Prudence and Firmneſs. How great ſoever the Degeneracy of Men may be, there is ſtill ſomething in Virtue, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts their Reſpect and their Love. The Endeavours of good Men againſt Vice, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with ſome Succeſs: If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Exhortations and good Examples does not reach far, they may at leaſt be uſeful to their Families and their Acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>But ſomething more than this is requiſite to reform general Cuſtoms and Practices; and none can do this more eaſily and effectually, than thoſe who are raiſed above other Men, and who are in publick Stations. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Secondly, that if Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates, would uſe their Authority to this End, and be exemplary themſelves, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the World would considerably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and bad Examples would neither be ſo frequent nor ſo forcible as they are. It is in
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96537:229"/>their Power to baniſh the greateſt part of thoſe Cuſtoms which are commonly received, and to eſtabliſh contrary ones. The Care and Example of Paſtors are likewiſe a moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Remedy. If they did inſtruct Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as they ought, if they did oppoſe the Corruption of the Age with the pure Maxims of the Goſpel, if they did ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Abuſes, if they did endeavour in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and in private, to bring all thoſe that err into the way of Truth, if they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the inſtructing of Youth, and if their Manners were edifying and exemplary, there is no doubt but that they would ſoon ſtop the Current of Vices and Scandals. It ſhould be their chief Care to oppoſe Abuſes and ill Cuſtoms in their beginnings; becauſe when they have once taken Root, the Remedy is much more difficult. In fine, as Cuſtoms are eſtabliſhed by degrees, ſo they are not aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all at once, and therefore thoſe who do not ſucceed at firſt in ſo good a Deſign, ought not preſently to be diſcouraged and to grow weary.</p>

                  <head>CAUSE. VII. Books.</head>
                  <p>THIS is the laſt Cauſe of Corruption which I ſhall mention, but without queſtion, it is one of the moſt generaland of the moſt remarkable. Books are as many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fountains, from which vaſt numbers of Notions and ſentiments which are commonly received among Men, and which are the Principles of their actions diffuſe themſelves into the World: And as it is impoſſible but that among an infinity of Books, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſt be bad, ſo it is certain that Books contribute very much to the keeping up of Corruption. If Men, as we have ſhewed in the precedent Chapters, are ignorant and full of Prejudices, if they have looſe and impious Notions concerning Religion, if great Defects are obſervable, both in the Lives of Chriſtians and in the ſtate of the Church in general; if the People are ill inſtructed, and Children are ill educated, the cauſe of all theſe Diſorders is partly to be found in Books. It is therefore a moſt important ſubject which I am to handle in this Chapter, but it is likewiſe a very large one by reaſon of the prodigious Multitude of Books, which I might have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak of here. But I muſt confine my
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:96537:230"/>ſelf to that which is moſt material to be ſaid upon this Head. I ſhall ſpeak 1. of Ill Books and 2. of Books of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The number of bad Books is infinite, and it would be very hard to give a Catalogue of them; but I think that among all the ſorts of ill Books none do greater Miſchief in the World, than either thoſe which lead to Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and Impiety, or thoſe which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and filthy. The firſt attack Faith, and the other corrupt Manners.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The moſt dangerous of all Books are thoſe which attack Religion, ſuch are not only all the Books of Atheiſts and Deiſts, but ſuch are likewiſe all thoſe Works which tend to overthrow, either the Authority of the Holy Scripture, or the Facts and Doctrines of Chriſtianity, or the difference between Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice, or any other Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Frank alſo in the ſame Order the Books which introduce Scepticiſm, and the deſign of which is, to render the Principles of Faith or Morality uncertain and dubious.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Books in which Impiety appears bare-faced, are not the moſt pernicious. Few Perſons ever durſt maintain Atheiſm openly, or deny directly the Fundamentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And beſides avowed Atheiſts and Deiſts have not many Followers. Their Opinions raiſe horrour, and a Man's Mind rebels againſt them. But thoſe Men, who tho' they do not openly eſpouſe the Cauſe of Impiety, but pretending all the while that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:96537:230"/>the exiſtence of a God and a Religion, do yet ſhake the principal Truths of Faith; thoſe Men I ſay, diffuſe a much more ſubtil and dangerous Poiſon; and this may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſaid of the Scepticks. In the main they drive at the ſame thing with the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, they aſſault Religion with the ſame Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and make the ſame objections. There is only this difference, that the Atheiſt decides the Queſtion and denies; whereas the Sceptick after he has muſtered up all the Objections of the Atheiſt and ſtarted a thouſand Scruples, leaves in ſome manner the Queſtion undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; he only inſinuates that there is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Anſwer to thoſe difficulties, and then he concludes with a falſe Modeſty, and tells us, that he dares not embrace either ſide, and that which way ſoever a Man turns himſelf, he meets with nothing but Obſcurity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: This differs little from Atheiſm, and it does naturally lead to incredulity.</p>
                  <p>It is an aſtoniſhing thing, that Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch pernicious Principles ſhould have been publiſhed, and that Libertiniſm in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about Religion, ſhould have grown up to that pitch which we now ſee it at. The Enemies of Chriſtianity did never oppoſe it with ſo much Subtlety and with ſuch vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Efforts, as ſome Chriſtians do at this day. Some Books appear from time to time, which are only Collections of all the Objections of Heathens and Atheiſts againſt the Exiſtence of God, againſt Providence, the Divinity of
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:96537:231"/>Scripture, the Truth of ſacred Hiſtory, the Foundations of Morality, and many other important Heads; ſo that Impiety is now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at its greateſt height. It might be more general, but we cannot imagine how it could riſe higher.</p>
                  <p>And this occaſions a very conſiderable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. It may be asked how it comes to paſs that Incredulity and Sceptiſm, ſhould appear in ſo knowing an Age as this is, and that Men of Parts and Learning ſhould entertain ſuch impious Sentiments? It is neceſſary to dwell a little upon the examining of this difficulty, becauſe it it ſo apt to perplex Many. The Infidels urge it with great aſſurance, and they pretend to infer for it, that Religion cannot and a Philoſophical and Learned Age, and that none but the Mob and the credulous part of Mankind believe it. They ſay that ignorant Ages were the moſt favourable times to Religion, that then every thing was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but that ſince Men have begun to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Matters a little more narrowly they are become incredulous.</p>
                  <p>But any reaſonable Man who does not love wrangling, may eaſily be ſatisfied upon this Point. Firſt Infidels have no ground to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Men had more Faith, in the Ages of ignorance than they have now; for this ſuppoſition is altogether falſe. There was but little Faith in thoſe Ages, for we are not to call by the name of Faith, a ſilly Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which made the groſſeſt impoſtures to paſs
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:96537:231"/>the Current for certain, and even for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths. The Infidels do likewiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe falſly that the Learning of an Age more enlightened that the precedent, is prejudicial to Religion; for on the contrary it has done great Services to it. If ſome ſubtil Spirits have attackt it, a great many knowing and judicious Perſons of extraordinary erudition and eminent worth have illuſtrated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the truth of it, with greater Solidity of Arguments, than ever was known before. This muſt be acknowledge to the Honour of God, and for the credit of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid that thoſe who make Objections againſt Religion, are learned; that the are Philoſophical Men, who in all other things reaſon true, and can diſtinguiſh truth from error. Let it be ſo; but then I ask thoſe who urge this Objection how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that we ſee every day Men of parts and ſenſe, who yet will obſtinately maintain pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Errors, and refuſe to yield to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſome Truths, which are clear as the Sun? To this nothing elſe can be ſaid, but that ſuch Men are not ſo knowing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacious as they ſhould be, or that they do not make that uſe which they ought of their Parts and Judgment. I confeſs that indeed a Man muſt have ſome Parts and Subtilty to be able to find difficulties every where. But that Man makes a wretched uſe of his Parts, when they ſerve him only to wrangle about the moſt certain Truths.</p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:96537:232"/>
                  <p>Thoſe which the Infidels call ſtrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Truths of Faith, are but for the moſt part vain Subtilties and meer Slights of Wit, which may be uſed alike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſorts of Subjects. That we may be convinced of this, I ſhall only name here ſome or thoſe Truths of Matters of Fact, which are thought unqueſtionable, and which no Man, tho' he had a Mind, can doubt of. It is certain that the ſame Objections by which the Infidels attack Religion, may be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Truths or Matters of fact. The Subtilties of Scepticiſm may puzzle a Man, who ſhall maintain, that there was heretofore an Emperour at <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or who ſhall believe with all Mankind that Parents ought to love their Children, and that it would be a ſin to murder a poor Wretch who is begging an Alms; I ſay a Man, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains theſe Truths, may be hard put to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can get rid of all the queſtions of a Captious Sophiſter, But does it follow from thence that this Man is miſtaken? It is to be imagined that a Man can doubt in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt whether or not there was ever at <hi>Rome</hi> an Emperour named <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to love their Children? Will any ever be ſo extravagant as to believe ſeriouſly, that it is indifferent whether we cut a poor Mans Throat, or give him an Alms? The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of Arguments ſignify nothing againſt facts which are well averred, or againſt thoſe
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96537:232"/>natural Sentiments, which are common to all Mankind. Now Religion is founded upon Facts, and its Principles are in part natural Truths and Sentiments, which we muſt needs feel and believe at all times. He that would deſtroy Religion muſt confute thoſe Fact and Sentiments, and Infidelity will never be able to do it,</p>
                  <p>Philoſophical Knowledge is very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled by the Infidels; they pretend chiefly to a great exactneſs in Reaſoning, and yet they viſibly run counter to right Reaſon, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Rules which true Philoſophy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. It is contrary to Reaſon, to judge that a thing is falſe or dubious, becauſe there are ſome difficulties in it; it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that no Man knows all Things, or is able to anſwer all Objections, and that what ſeems obſcure to one Man, will appear very clear to another. When we have Reaſons on the other hand to believe that a thing is true, when its Proofs are ſtronger and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than its difficulties, and when there are Proofs which upon other occaſions are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine our Judgment, true Senſe requires that we ſhould yield to ſuch an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. This Method is particularly to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owed, when the Matter in queſtion is of ſome moment. In ſuch things we are wont to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our ſelves by the greater Evidence, and to chuſe the ſafer ſide. What can be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more Irrational, than to hazard Eternity, and to queſtion the Truth of Religion, up
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:96537:233"/>on ſuch Conſiderations as would have no weight with us, and as would not ſtop us a Minute in the Ordinary Affairs of this Life?</p>
                  <p>Further, it is contrary to the Rules of good Senſe, to paſs a judgment upon thoſe things of which we have no diſtinct Idea, or which we do not thoroughly know. Men who can give no account of the Operations of their Souls, or of a hundred things, they ſee before their Eyes, will yet talk at random about the manner in which God Acts, or foreſees future evants, about what God ought or ought not to have done for the Orderly diſpoſing of all things, about the ends which that Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſes to it ſelf, and about the Means which may conduce to thoſe Ends. This is the height of Extravagance and Temerity, and yet it is at this rate, that the Infidels Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>I muſt add beſides, that Men of Parts are ſubject to the ſame Paſſions with the Vulgar, and that thoſe Paſſions hinder them from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truth. Theſe Makers of Objections who pretend to Politeneſs and Wit, are not generally ſound at Heart, but they love Licentiouſneſs; they are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted perhaps to a groſs and ſhameful, but to a more refined Libertiniſm; they obſerve a little Decorum, but they do not reliſh the Maxims of Devotion and Piety, and they cannot endure to be tied to them. Vanity has likewiſe a great ſhare in their Conduct. A great many imagine, that it is for their Credit to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:96537:233"/>Vulgar, and not to believe the things which are believed by the People: And when they have once embraced this way and ſet up for Scepticks in the World, they think themſelves bound in point of honour, to maintain that Character.</p>
                  <p>Men of Knowledge are ſometimes govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Prejudices, and falſe Motives. A preconceived Notion or a meer Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſufficient to determine them to the embracing of an Opinion. What has been ſaid of the Conduct of Princes, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Opinions and Hypotheſes of the Learned. Wars and ſuch other great Events, upon which the Fate of Nations depends, and which make ſo much ſtir in the World, do not always proceed from Wiſe and Mature Deliberation; ſometimes they are but the effect of a Paſſion, of a Humour, or of ſome particular Circumſtance. Thus it is with the Learned: We think too well of them, if we fancy that they are always determined by the greater Weight of Reaſon. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which prompt them to maintain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Opinions, are often very ſlight. They are not ſenſible of this, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guided by Reaſon, and they do not perceive the true Principle of their Actions or Judgments. If Infidels did ſtrictly examine themſelves, they would find perhaps, that their Scruples were firſt raiſed and have been maintained ſince, either by ſome Book they read when they were Young, or by the Love
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:96537:234"/>they had for ſome Perſons, or by their Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to others, or by ſome ill treatment they have met with, or by the Praiſes which have been given them for their Wit, or by ſome Prejudice they have conceived againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in General when they heard it ill defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or againſt certain Tenets which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the Society they live in and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly abſurd; or by ſome other Motion of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>If we call to mind in the laſt Place, what has been ſaid in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to wit, that few Chriſtians apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſincerely to the ſtudy of the general Truths, and of the Principles of Faith; we ſhall not wonder that among ſo many, who never inquired into the Proofs of Religion, ſome ſhould be inveigled by the Objections of Libertines, and fall into Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>I have in a manner ſtept out of my way; but this Digreſſion is not impertinent, ſince theſe Conſiderations may ſerve as a remedy, againſt Incredulity and Scepticiſm, which ſome Authors would fain eſtabliſh by their Writings.</p>
                  <p>One would think that every body ſhould abhor thoſe Impious Books, but yet they are read and liked by many Perſons. Young People eſpecially, who for the moſt part love Novelty, and are inclined to Vanity and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, do eaſily imbibe the Principles which are ſcattered through ſuch Books: They are impoſed upon by the Genteelneſs,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:96537:234"/>the Wit, and ſome kind of Learning which they commonly find there: Being not well grounded in Religion, they are ſtruck with the Reaſonings of Infidels; they very firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection puzzles them; they begin to doubt of many things, and in a little time they become thorough-paced Scepticks. I leave any one to judge, what effects this may produce in an Age ſo prone to Vice as this is, and if Young People can avoid being Corrupted when they are no longer reſtrained by Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. There is no Condition more remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, nor is there any State more deplorable, than when Incredulity is joyned with diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of Manners. People then are hardly to be reclaimed; Age and ill Life fortifie their Doubts and Scruples, and they continue in that State to their dying Day. This is the fruit which many reap from the reading of thoſe pernicious Books, but it is not all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which is occaſioned by ſuch Writings. They may fall into the Hands of many who have no great compaſs of Knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſeveral Scruples in the Minds even of good Men. After theſe Reflections, I make no doubt but it will be granted, that no Books are more dangerous than theſe, and that to have the Confidence of Publiſhing them, is a ſuperlative Degree of Impiety.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Books I have now ſpoken of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault Religion and Piety in general, and by conſequence open a door to all manner of Diſorders and Vices. There are others which
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:96537:235"/>tho' they do not attack the Principles of Faith, do yet introduce Licentiouſneſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It would be a long Work, if I ſhould ſpecify here their ſeveral ſorts, which are as many as there are Vices, Paſſions, or received Errors among Men: This is a Detail which I cannot enter into. Being then forced to ſtint my ſelf, I ſhall only ſpeak of impure Books: And I chuſe this particular Species of ill Books, becauſe the number of theſe is not only very great, but becauſe they are thoſe likewiſe, which do moſt generally Corrupt Men.</p>
                  <p>Their Number is prodigious. Firſt we have the Obſcene Books of the Heathen, which are not only read by Men, but are put likewiſe into the Hands of Youth. Some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo infatuated with theſe Books, that they fancy a Man cannot be a Maſter of Greek or Latin, unleſs he has read all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenities written in thoſe Two Languages; which is as extravagant an Opinion, as if a Man ſhould pretend that whoſever deſigns to acquire a thorough Knowledge of the French, or of any other living Language, and to be able to ſpeak and write elegantly in it, muſt read all the leud Poems, and all the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Books which this Age has produced.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Beſides impure Books of Pagan Authors, we have thoſe that are writ by Chriſtians. The World is ove-run with Books of this Stamp, their Number increaſes every Day, and their amazing multitude is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:96537:235"/>one of the ſtrongeſt Proofs of the extream Corruption of the Times. It is the laſt degree of Impudence to write in that Style, and then to diſperſe it in the World by the Preſs: The Diſſolution muſt need be very great, when this is done ſo freely and ſo often as it is in this Age. Nothing can be imagined more laſcivious or execrable than ſome Books which have been, and ſtill are Publiſhed from time to time: Paganiſm did never produce any thing more abominable upon the Head of Impurity than ſeveral Works which were hatched in the very Boſom of Chriſtianity; ſo that in this reſpect Chriſtians have no cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Heathens.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Deteſtable Books are not the only Impure ones, nor perhaps the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; vaſt Numbers of others are currant in the World. What are ſo many Books of Love and Gallantry, ſo many Scandalous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels either feigned or true, and ſo many Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Pieces of Poetry, but the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Spirit of Impurity and Diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which prevails in this Age? Nay, even Books of Learning which Treat of ſerious Subjects, have a mixture of Impurity. This Infection is diffuſed through all ſorts of Books, and appears every Day in ſome new Shape.</p>
                  <p>As the number of Impure Books is great, ſo their effect is moſt pernicious; and none ought to wonder that I ſhould aſſign theſe Books as one of the general Cauſes of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. No bad Books are more generally read
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:96537:236"/>than theſe, none can with more reaſon be called Publick Fountains of Vice and Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs. The Miſchief they do in the World cannot be imagined. They prove to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Perſons, but eſpecially to Young People, Schools of Licentiouſneſs. It is by the reading of them, that Youth learn to know and to love Vice. That Age is prone to Pleaſure and to every thing that gratified Senſe; and that Inclination is ſo much the ſtronger, becauſe it is cheriſhed and fortified by an Education altogether ſenſual, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Young People for want of good Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, have not much Piety, nor any great Averſion to Vice. From whence we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge, that they are ſuſceptible of thoſe Paſſions which gratifie Senſuality; and that it is hard for them to reſiſt thoſe Impreſſions. which the reading of impure Books conveys into their Minds. We ſee in Fact, that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs is commonly the firſt Sin and the firſt Paſſion which ſeduces Men in their Youth, and which engages them into Vice, for their whole Life: For it ſeldom happens but that all the Ages of Life, retain a ſpice of the Irregularities of Youth.</p>
                  <p>And yet for all that, theſe Books have their Advocates. Many Perſons reckon, that there is no harm either in reading, or even in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them. If we believe ſome Authors, who infect the publick with Books full of Obſcenities; none but fantaſtical People, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeffed with a ridiculous and preciſe Devotion
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:96537:236"/>find fault with thoſe who write upon this Subject. And in defence of their Opinion, they alledge this Maxim,<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>To the pure all things are pure;</hi> as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> who does not allow Chriſtians ſo much as to ſpeak an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent word, did permit them to read and write things which are contrary to Modeſty and may occaſion Scandal: From this Maxim they conclude, that there is nothing is thoſe Books that offends Modeſty or Religion; and they proteſt that for their part, the reading of them does not defile their Imagination. I do not know the particular Frame of thoſe Men's Hearts; perhaps impure. Idea's and laſcivious Objects, are grown ſo familiar to them, that they do no longer perceive, that ſuch Idea's and Objects make any impreſſion upon them. But it is unconceivable how People can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a chaſte Heart, when they delight in Writing or Reading filthy things. After all, tho' they reading of ſuch Works ſhould have no ill effects upon ſome Perſons, there are a great many more who will make an ill uſe of them; And this is enough to make every Many who has any Senſe of Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt impure Books.</p>
                  <p>What I have now ſaid will be granted by many, but it will be thought, that to rank Books of Love and Gallantry among impure Books, and to condemn the reading of them, is ſomething to ſevere. I confeſs that all thoſe Books are not equally bad, and that
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:96537:237"/>ſome do not hurt Modeſty ſo viſibly as others do. But yet there are not many, in which a Spirit of Impurity and Licentiouſneſs may not be obſerved. That Love which makes the Subject of ſo many Books, is nothing elſe at bottom, but an impure and irregular Paſſion, of which the Goſpel obliges us to ſtifle the very firſt Motions. What the World calls a mere Intrigue of Gallantry, is ſometimes a pretty large ſtep towards the Sin of Adultery. Sin indeed may be diſguiſed in thoſe Books un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Name, and may be dreſſed in a modeſt Garb, but that makes it ſlide the more eaſily into the Mind. It is dangerous to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with things, which deſerve the almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Chriſtian; and it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that the horrour of Impurity and of every thing that comes near it, muſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abate, in any one who is addicted to ſuch Readings. There are two Maxims in the Goſpel which decide this Matter; the one is, <hi>That we are to abſtain from the appearance of evil;</hi> the other, that in things indifferent, we ought to avoid whatſoever may prove a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal or an occaſion of falling to any body, eſpecially when the Scandal may be foreſeen. Now here is at leaſt the appearance of Evil; it is certain that divers Perſons will make an ill uſe of thoſe Books, and by conſequence the reading arid publiſhing of them cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
                  <p>But as if it were not enough to maintain,<note place="bottom">* 1 Theff. V. XXII. See Rom. XIV. 1. Cop. X. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:96537:237"/>that the Books in Queſtion may be read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, it is pretended beſides that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is uſeful and neceſſary to open the Minds of young People. I do not deny but that it is a valuable Quality to have quick and well-faſhioned Parts, but there are other Books which may be read without danger, and which are much fitter to form the Minds and Judgments of young People, than Books of Gallantry, the reading of which, every body knows, has often ſpoiled the Minds of thoſe who were given to it The greateſt Miſchief that attends this kind of reading, is that it corrupts the Heart and ſullies the Imagination, at the ſame time that it opens the Mind. Now it were better to have a little leſs of that faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs and politeneſs of Parts, which is ſo much eſteemed in the World, than to acquire it at the expence of one's Innocency.</p>
                  <p>But ſome People do not ſtop here. They proceed ſo far as to ſay, that theſe Books are uſeful even in reference to Religion, and that they are proper to reſtrain Youth from Vice; becauſe we ſee in them the Follies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which irregular Paſſions betray Men into. I can hardly think that this is alledged in earneſt. It is a ſtrange ſort of Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Impurity, to make agreeable Pictures of Love, and to repreſent minutely, and in a natural and inſinuating manner, all the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which that Paſſion excites in thoſe who are poſſeſt with it. We muſt be very ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Tempers of Men, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:96537:238"/>of young People, if we can fancy that the reading of ſuch Books, will put them upon Moral Reflections, and inſpire them with an averſion to Vice. Daily experience ſhews that nothing is more vain or falſe than ſuch an Imagination.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid, that at leaſt thoſe Books ought to be excepted, in which among Love-Matters and licentious Subjects, the Reader meets with fine Moralities; which may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſerve for a Preſervative. But theſe Books are not much better than the others; nay, I cannot tell whether they are not more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Thoſe Moralities are very ill placed, and few People are the better for them. It is a very ſuſpicious kind of Morality, which comes from the Pen of thoſe Authors, who write in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently upon Matters of Love, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects, who ſometimes ſeem to be Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and ſometimes devout; who after they have ſaid a hundred licentious things, given you the Hiſtory of a great many Diſorders, and related ſeveral ſcandalous Paſſages; entertain you with Devotion and Piety: This is a monſtrous Mixture. If thoſe Authors were truly religious, they would forbear writing thoſe things which Religion condemns, and which ſcandalize the publick. Such Books are particularly fit to confirm worldly Men in their Opinion, that Gallantry, provided it does not proceed to the higheſt degree of Crimes is no great Sin, and to perſuade young People that they may eaſily grow devout
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96537:238"/>here after, tho' they now ſpend their Youth in Libertiniſm. From all theſe Confiderations I infer, that let People ſay what they will, all the Books which preſent their Readers with Impurity, either bare-faced, or under ſome Veil, are extreamly pernicious.</p>
                  <p>Having thus diſcourſed of ill Books, I come now to the Books of Religion. It may ſeem at firſt, that I ſhould rather ſeek in theſe the Remedy, than the Cauſe of Corruption. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the end of religious Books ſhould be to baniſh Corruption and to eſtabliſh Piety in the World, and there are many of them which attack Ignorance and Vice with Succeſs, and which may prove excellent Preſervatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Corruption of the Age. But I hope no body will take it amiſs if I ſay that there are Books of Religion, which do not conduce much to the promoting of Piety, nay that ſome prove a hindrance to it.</p>
                  <p>This I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew. I ſhall not ſpeak of any particular Book, I will only offer ſome general Conſiderations, which my Readers may apply as they ſee Cauſe. It is not my Deſign to rank among bad Books all thoſe Works, to which ſome of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflections may be applied. Some indeed are downright bad, but may are in ſeveral reſpects good and uſeful, tho' they have their Faults; and as good Books ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from bad ones, ſo it is not leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to diſcern what is good in every Book, from what is naught or uſeleſs.</p>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:96537:239"/>
                  <p>The Books of Religion which I think ought here to be taken notice of, are of four ſorts. 1. Thoſe which explain the Scripture. 2. The Books of Divinity. 3. The Books of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. 4. The Books of Devotion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It cannot be denied but that among the Books of the firſt ſort there are ſome very good ones, and that we have at this Day great Helps for the underſtanding of the Holy Scripture. But it ought likewiſe to be granted, that ſome of thoſe Books which are deſigned for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Scripture, do only obſcure and perplex the Senſe of it. It would be tedious to mention here all the Defects of that kind of Writing, I ſhall therefore obſerve only the Principal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt and the moſt Eſſential is the not Expounding of Scripture, according to its true Meaning; and this Fault, which is but too frequent in Commentaries, proceeds chiefly from two Cauſes: 1. That Expoſitors do not apprehend the Scope of the Sacred Writers: and, 2. That they enter with Prejudices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reading of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The true way to underſtand the Scripture, is, to know the Scope of it, and never to ſwerve from that. Good Senſe and Piety, joined with the Study of Languages, Hiſtory, and Antiquity, are here very ſerviceable. A Commentator ought in a manner to tranſport himſelf into thoſe Places and Times in which the Sacred Authors lived. He ſhould fancy himſelf in their Circumſtances, and conſider
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96537:239"/>what their Deſign was when they ſpoke or writ, what Perſons they had to deal with, and what Notions, Knowledge, or Cuſtoms did then obtain. But thoſe who, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norane of theſe things, ſet about Expounding the Scripture, can hardly do it with Succeſs. It is a Wonder if they do not miſs the true Mark; and if they do not obtrude forced, and very often falſe, Gloſſes upon their Readers.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, many Authors apply themſelves to the examining of Scripture with a Mind full of Prejudices. They explain in by the preſent Notions of the World. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uſual with Commentators than to make the Faithful under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeak as if they had been as well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Truths of the Goſpel as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are; and as if thoſe Queſtions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, which are treated in Common-Places of Divinity, had been agitated at that time. When thoſe Expoſitors, for Inſtance, meet with the World <hi>Righteous</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> they fancy that <hi>David</hi> had in his Thoughts all that Divines have vented concerning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; and upon this Suppoſal, what do they not ſay, or what do they not make Preachers ſay? It has been obſerved, that almoſt all Commentators are partial and endeavour to put upon the Scripture a Senſe that favours the Opinions of their reſpective Sects. This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Party is chiefly remarkable in ſome of thoſe Commentaries which theſe laſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have produced.</p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:96537:240"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Rule of a Commentator ſhould be, to expound clearly and familiarly the literal Senſe of Scripture, and never to have recourſe to a myſtical Expoſition, but in thoſe Places where the Spirit of God directs us to look for it: And yet a great many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do almoſt entirely forſake the literal Senſe, to purſue myſtical Explications. In their Opinion, every thing is myſtical in the Holy Scripture, eſpecially in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are not contented with unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Myſteries and Prophecies which manifeſtly relate to the Times of the Goſpel, but they turn all things into Figure. They find Myſteries, Allegories, Types and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies every where, even in the plaineſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. This they call ſearching and diving into the Scriptures. But this way of expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God is a Fountain of Illuſions: For as the Holy Ghoſt does not explain thoſe pretended Myſteries, ſo they muſt be put to their Gueſſes and beholden to their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Diſcovery of them; and he that is the moſt copious or lucky in his Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, is the greateſt Man. Now I leave any one to judge, whether Commentators, who follow no other Guide but their Imagination, can avoid being very frequently miſtaken, and giving a great many handles to Libertines and Infidels.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not to forget here the School-Commentators. The Holy Scripture ſhould be expounded in a ſimple and popular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96537:240"/>and this cannot be denied, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it was given for the Inſtruction and the Salvation of all Men, and that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Common People, and to ſuch Perſons as were far from being Philoſophers. Nothing therefore ſeems more repugnant to the Deſign of Scripture, than to explain it Philoſophically, and, which is worſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of a falſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as divers Commentators do. They make uſe of the Method, Notions, and Terms of the Schools, to find out the Meaning of the Sacred Writings. They apply to all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Rules preſcribed by the School-men. They carefully diſtinguiſh in a Text thoſe Things which are called in the Schools <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Forma, Cauſa efficiens, Finis, Subjectum, Adjunctum,</hi> &amp;c. They ſeek in all Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the <hi>Major,</hi> the <hi>Minor,</hi> and they Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if the Holy Ghoſt, in inſpiring the Sacred Authors, had followed the Scheme of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Logick, and had intended to make Syllogiſms in Mood and Figure. I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of that Spirit of Diſpute and Wrangling which run through the Scholaſtical Commentaries, nor of the falſe Senſes and metaphyſical Explications, which they put upon the Scripture. Such Books are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles rather than Helps to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God; they are fit only to perplex what is clear, and to ſpoil Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Preachers, by taking away from
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:96537:241"/>them that Qualification they have moſt need of, I mean Good Senſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another very different way from that Simplicity with which the Scripture ſhould be handled, is the Method of thoſe Authors, who without Neceſſity inſiſt upon all the Circumſtances of a Text, who ſift all the Terms of it, as if a Myſtery did lurk in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word; who deſcend to the minuteſt Things, and weary themſelves in Conjectures and Queſtions. This Exactneſs is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inſipid. It may be ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to clear a Difficulty, to unfold an intricate Meaning, and to obſerve the critical Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Words: But when the Senſe is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eaſie, and when the Words are clear, to what Purpoſe ſhould a Man inſiſt upon all thoſe Illuſtrations? What need is there for him to be always preſſing the Signification of Words, to remark all their different Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to explain what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Words, <hi>Death, Faith, Juſt,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time that theſe Terms occur. The true Method is to purſue the Things themſelves and the Meaning of a Text, without critici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon Worlds and Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the Fault of many Commentators to be prolix and too large. From every Verſe, nay, from every Word, they take occaſion to run into a Common-Place, and to vent a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Notions, ſo that they really give us Sermons, Diſſertations, or Lectures of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, under the Title of Commentaries. I
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:96537:241"/>do not abſolutely condemn diffus'd Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; we meet ſometimes with good things in them, but we find there likewiſe a great many which ſignifie nothing. When all is done, Brevity, Clearneſs, and Exactneſs, are infinitely to be preferred in a Commentary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prolixity and Copiouſneſs: Such Length breeds Obſcurity and Confuſion, it makes Preachers lazy, it tempts them to fill their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with a hundred needleſs things, it brings them to a Cuſtom of being tedious, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Digreſſions, and of paſſing by that which is eſſential and ſolid: All which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from promoting the Edification of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is evident that the Defects of Commentaries contribute very much to the Corruption of Chriſtians. The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Foundation of Religion and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but Commentaries are the Stores from which the Senſe of Scripture is drawn, and from which Preachers commonly take the Matter of their Sermons. Few of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out the Senſe of a Text by their own Induſtry; they conſult their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries like Oracles, and they blindly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Deciſions. It is therefore highly requiſite that theſe Books ſhould not lead into Error thoſe who have recourſe to them. When a bind Man leads another, they both fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ditch. If then the Guides, to whoſe Conduct Preachers give up themſelves, are deceitful and falſe, the Word of God will
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:96537:242"/>neither be well underſtood, nor well preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and both Preachers and People will err.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is with Divinity-Books as with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries; ſome are good, and others bad. The Diverſity of Opinions which we ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Authors, is a Proof of what I ſay: Some maintain, as Divine Truths, Things which others reject as falſe and pernicious Sentiments; ſo that there muſt be no ſmall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror on one ſide or the other. All Divines will own the Truth of this Remark; but it is here of no uſe, becauſe it does not decide which Books of Divinity are good, and which are bad. Every body will pretend that the bad Books are thoſe which teach a Doctrine contrary to that, which obtains in the Society to which he belongs. In order to know who is in the Right, or in the Wrong, it would be neceſſary to judge here upon the Merits of the Cauſe, and to enter into the Examination of all the Controverſies which divide Chriſtians. But this I will by no means take upon me to do: It will be fitter for me to take notice of thoſe Faults which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the greateſt part of Divinity-Books. I ſhall ſay nothing but what muſt needs be owned by all the ſenſible Divines of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the Reflections I am to make, tho' General, may perhaps be of ſome uſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Judgment concerning the Doctrine it ſelf contained in thoſe Books.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Almoſt all the Authors who have writ of Divinity, have made of it, upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:96537:242"/>a Science of meer Speculation. They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh certain Doctrines, they deliver their Opinions, they prove them as well as they can; they treat of Controverſies, and confute their Adverſaries; but they do not ſeem to have meditated much upon the Uſe of the Doctrines they teach, with relation to Piety and Salvation. They are very ſhort upon this Head, which yet is the chiefeſt of all; they are not by half ſo ſolicitous to aſſert the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they are to maintain the Truths of Religion. Now this is not teaching Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Deſign of Religion is to teach Men how they ought to ſerve God, and to make them Holy and Happy. If this was conſidered in the handling of Divinity, and if Care was taken to ſhew what Relation all the Parts of Religion have to the Glory of God, and to the Holineſs and Felicity of Man, there would be much more Piety than there is now among Chriſtians. Thoſe who ſtudy Divinity would learn betimes to direct it to its true End; and this would likewiſe be a means to diſtinguiſh material from inſignificant Points and Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to eaſe Religion of all thoſe needleſs Diſputes, which are one of the main Cauſes of the Corruption of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What I have now ſaid leads me to a ſecond Obſervation; which is, That as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things might be left out of Divinity-Books, ſo other things are wanting, which it would be neceſſary to add to them. For the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Common-Places do not inſiſt much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:96537:243"/>on the General Truths and Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They ſcarce give us any Inſtruction about Church-Diſcipline and Government, or about the Belief and Practice of the Firſt Ages of Chriſtianity: As for Morality, it is there touched but very ſuperficially. And yet theſe are eſſential Articles in Divinity, the Knowledge of which is neceſſary to thoſe who are called to preach the Goſpel, to guide a Church, or to direct Mens Conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Divinity-Books are, for the moſt part, too Scholaſtical. The Method of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens way of handling Divinity may juſtly be looked upon as a Defiance to Senſe and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet that Method has prevailed to that degree, that for ſome Ages it was not lawful to ſwerve from it. Of late Years indeed the School men have loſt a great deal of heir Credit; and in Divinity, as well as in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, many Perſons have no longer that blind Deference for them which was paid heretofore. Yet, for all that, a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Divines do ſtill ſet up that Method for their Rule, and it is ſtill as it were ſacred in Colleges and Univerſities. Common-Places to this Day ſavour too much of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of the Schools, and we find there but too many Remainders of that dry and crabbed Theology, which had its Birth in the Ages of Ignorance. Inſtead of thoſe ſimple and clear Ideas, which render the Truth and Majeſty of the Chriſtian Religion ſenſible, and which
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:96537:243"/>ſatisfie a Man's Reaſon, and move his Heart, we meet with nothing in ſeveral Bodies of Divinity but Metaphiſical Notions, curious and needleſs Queſtions, Diſtinctions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Terms. In a word, we find there ſuch intricate Theology, that the very Apoſtles themſelves if they came into the World again, would not be able to underſtand it, without the help of a particular Revelation. This Scholaſtick Divinity, has done more miſchief to Religion, than we are able to expreſs. There is not any thing that has more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Purity of the Chriſtian Religion, that has more obſcured Matters, multiplied Controverſies, diſturbed the Peace of the Church, or given riſe to ſo many Hereſies and Schiſms. This is the thing which confirms ſo many Eccleſiaſticks in their Ignorance and Prejudices, and which keeps them from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to the ſolid Parts of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to that which is proper to ſanctify Men.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Defects are viſible Cauſes of Corruption, which may be proved by this ſingle Conſideration; that it is in Common-Places that Church-men learn their Divinity: Suppoſing then that thoſe Books do not give them a true Idea of Religion, what Religion or what Divinity can ſuch Men Teach their People? One ſcholaſtick and injudicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who is in Credit in Country, and who is patronized by a Profeſſor, is enough to ſpoil the Minds of Young Divines, and to bring into repute the moſt abſurd and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Opinions and Syſtems.</p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:96537:244"/>
                  <p>Tho' Catechiſms are not uſually reckoned among Divinity-Books, yet it will not be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſay ſomething of them here. Some great Men have beſtowed their pains upon Works of this kind to very good purpoſe; and yet in this reſpect there is ſtall ſomething to be deſired for publick Edification. 1. It is to be wiſhed that thoſe Subject ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be treated in Catechiſms, which ought to be handle there, and that all the Matters and Queſtions which are above the reach of the People and of Children, or which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, ſhould be baniſhed from thence. 2. That ſome eſſential Articles, about which Catechiſms are very jejune ſhould be added to them, and particularly theſe Three; A general Idea of the Hiſtory of the Bible; the main Proofs of the Fundamental Truths of Religion; and an exact Explication of the Duties of Morality. This laſt Article is for the moſt part extreamly neglected in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms; nothing can be more dry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial than what they ſay upon the Decalogue. 3. It would be fitting to make ſome alteration in the method obſerved in Catechiſms; for they are not all familiar enough: School Terms or figurative Phraſes are uſed in them, which either the People do not underſtand, or to which they affix falſe Ideas. For inſtance, I would not have it ſaid, <hi>That the Euchariſt is the ſymbol of our ſpiritual Nouriſhment, and of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For beſides that this is not an exact Definition, this Style is not proper for a Catechiſm. Theſe Words <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96537:244"/>ſpiritual Nouriſhment, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are figurative and obſcure Terms. Would not the thing be plainer both to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and to every Body, if we ſhould ſay, That the Euchariſt is a ſacred Action and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, wherein Chriſtians eat Bread and drink Wine, which are diſtributed in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Death of Chriſt, and of the Redemption wrought by him? In thoſe Works which are intended for Youth and for the Common People, it concerns and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to be clear and accurate, to omit nothing that is eſſential, to ſay nothing that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to uſe plain and proper Expreſſions, and to propoſe nothing but what is natural and eaſy to be apprehended. Catechiſms are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to give Children the firſt Tinctures and Ideas of Religion: Now thoſe Ideas, we know, commonly ſtick by them as long as they live; if then they are not clear and true, it is not poſſible for them ever to be well acquainted with their Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The third ſort of Books are thoſe of Morality. This important Part of Religion which regulates Manners, has been treated with a great deal of ſolidity and force in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Excellent Works. Nay, it is obſerved that Morality is more cultivated of late than it has been heretofore. But it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the good Books of Morality we have at this Day, were of a more general Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than they are. The beſt Works of this kind, are above the Peoples Capacity. There are various things in them, relating either to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:96537:245"/>the Reaſoning part, the turn of Thoughts, or the Style, which cannot be underſtood, but by knowing and diſcerning Perſons. Almoſt all the Able Men who write upon Morals have this Fault, that they ſpeak too much like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Men, and do not accomodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enough to the Capacity of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They do not conſider that they ought to be uſeful to every body, that what ſeems clear to them, is obſcure to the greateſt part of thoſe who peruſe their Writings, and that a Book of Morality, which is only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Men of Parts of Learning, is of a very limited uſefulneſs. They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at leaſt in ſome of their Works, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſpeak in a popular manner, and to handle Matters with all poſſible clearneſs and ſimplicity. This would be no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, and the doing it well would, I think, require all the Abilities, Parts, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, of the beſt Writers: It is more difficult than is ſeems, to ſpeak or write in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that a Man ſhall ſay all that is proper to be ſaid, and at the ſame time be intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all ſorts of Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But if there are good Books of Morality, there are many on the other hand, which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Faults in them, and thoſe Faults are of great Conſequence, becauſe Morality ill Explained, is capable of doing more hurt than good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Author who Treats of Morality, ſhould always have theſe Two Rules in his view. 1. To explain exactly the Nature of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:96537:245"/>the Duties which it preſcribe. And 2. to perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>de Men to the practice of thoſe Duties. Now theſe Two Rules have not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obſerved by all thoſe who have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Moral Books. 1. They do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repreſent with due exactneſs the Nature of Vice or Virtue. Either the Notions they give of them are not true, or they are too general. On the one hand, they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate enough, in deſcribing the true Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of each Virtue and Vice; and on the other hand, they do not diſtinguiſh their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kinds and Degrees, which yet ought to be done if they intend that Men ſhould know their own Pictures. 2. They do not preſs Men enough to the practice of Virtue. The End of Morality, is to work upon Man's Heart and Paſſions. In order to compaſs this End Two things are neceſſary. 1. That all thoſe great Motives which the Goſpel affords, ſhould be ſtrongly urged: And 2. that the falſe Reaſons and Motives which engage Men into the Love of this World and give them any Averſion to Holineſs, ſhould be Confuted. Morals cannot be uſefully handled without the obſervation of theſe Two Maxims, the ſecond eſpecially: for the Reaſon why many are not prevailed upon by the Arguments and Motives which are offered to them is, becauſe they are hindred by other Arguments and Motives. A Reader frames in himſelf a Hundred Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt what he reads in a Book of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Man's Heart is no ſooner inclined to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vice, but it grows fertile in Evaſions,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:96537:246"/>Reaſons, and Pretences. Every Sinner has his Excuſes and his Shifts. If theſe who Teach Morality do not obviate thoſe Objections and deſtroy thoſe Excuſes, they can never obtain their Deſign; but this is a trouble which few Authors care to take upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Books of Morals would produce more fruit than they do, if the Morality they Teach was neither too much relaxed, nor too ſevere. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is relaxed, when it does not propoſe the Duties of a Chriſtian Life in their full extent, or when it does not aſſert the abſolute neceſſity of the obſervation of thoſe Duties. It is ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and too ſevere, when it impoſes Duties which God has not Commanded, or which cannot poſſibly be practiſed; and when it ranks among Sins things which are innocent. I touch this only by the by, becauſe I have ſpoken already in ſome other Places of this Treatiſe, both of the remiſs and over ſevere Notions which Men form to themſelves about Religion. See Part I. Cauſe I. Art. II. and Cauſe II. Art. V, VI. and Part II. Cauſe III. Art. I.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some of the Authors who handle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are guilty of another Fault, and that is a want of accuracy and exactneſs in their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas and Reaſonings. They do not conſider enough whether every thing they advance is ſtrictly ſolid and true, whether the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they lay down will hold, whether their Maxims are not ſtretched too far or abſurd, whether they do not contradict themſelves, whether they do not make uſe of frivolous Reaſons, whether nothing is falſe or mean
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:96537:246"/>in the Motives they urge, in a word whether or not their works will be able to ſtand the Cenſure of a Judicious Reader. Moraliſts as well as the generality of Preachers, are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too much carried away by the heat of their Imagination and Zeal, and they do not reaſon enough. They often go about to move People with Rhethorical Figures, rather than by dint of reaſons. And this is a very ill Method. In Matters of Morality, it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns a Man to ſpeak and to argue cloſe; without this it is impoſſible that he ſhould either convince the Mind or produce a ſolid and diſerning Piety.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The World is full of Books of Morality, and yet there are ſeveral important ſubjects which have not hitherto been treated as they ought, or if they have, it was in Works which are not read by the People. Thoſe who ſtudy Morality are often ſenſible of this defect, and complain juſtly that they do not find in Books, all the light and helps they look for there: It is but of late that any thing has been writ with exactneſs in French, upon Reſtitution. Who can doubt but that a good Book concerning Impurity would be highly uſeful? This ſin is exceeding common, but it is one of thoſe about which the People are the leaſt inſtructed. If Chriſtians underſtood the Nature of this Vice, its Conſequences, and the duties of thoſe who have fallen into it, they would certainly avoid it more carefully than they do. I might ſay the ſame of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, of Swearing, and of ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:96537:247"/>
                  <p n="4">IV. I come in the Laſt place to Books of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It is very neceſſary to make a right Choice of them, becauſe of all the Books of Religion they are thoſe which are the moſt read.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I cannot help ſaying in the firſt place that there are Books of Devotion which are capable of introducing Corruption of Manners, and diverting Chriſtians from the ſtudy of Holineſs. We may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily apprehend how there ſhould be Books of this kind, if we confider that many, even among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, think it dangerous to inſiſt upon good Works, and to preſs Morality: And there are Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which were made on purpoſe to maintain ſo ſtrange an Opinion. Some Authors have taught that true Devotion and ſolid Piety, is not that which conſiſts in the Practice of Good Works; they have writ that the Doctrine which repreſents good Works as a neceſſary condition in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, overthrows the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith; that Works cannot be looked upon as the way to Heaven; that all we have to do now under the Goſpel Covenant, is to receive and to accept of the Salvation purchaſed for us, and that the Goſpel requires Works, only from the Motives of Gratitude and Love. Nay thoſe Authors enter into diſpute; they refute the Arguments drawn from the Exhortations, Promiſes and Threatnings of Scripture, which might be urged againſt them, and they tax with Phariſaiſm or Pelagianiſm thoſe who are of an Opinion Contrary to their. I cannot think the Authors of ſuch Books did publiſh them with ill intentions, but I could wiſh they had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riting things which gives ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty advantages of Libertines, and which may blaſt the fruit of all the Books of Morality, and of all the Exhortations which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e addreſſed to Sinners. And yet theſe Books are Printed, and which is more ſurprizing, thoſe Divines who are ſo rigid
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:96537:247"/>and ſcrupulous in point of Books and Sentiments, do not oppoſe the publiſhing of ſuch Works, but they ſuffer them quietly to paſs for Current in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Books of Myſtical Devotion are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt dangerous: and their number is greater than we imagine. For to ſay nothing of thoſe in which Myſtical and Fanatical Principles are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed, many Works which are otherwiſe full of good things are ſprinkled with that Spirit of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm. I ſhall not ſtand to give here the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe Books, nor to ſhew the miſchief they may do in relation to Libertines, or to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who want either Knowledge or a diſcerning Judgment; becauſe I will not repeat what I have ſaid of Myſtical Piety. Part I. Cauſe II. Art VIII.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some Authors who have put out Books of Piety have made it their whole Buſineſs to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Comfort. Thoſe who read their Works, may eaſily ſee that they looked upon the Comfortable ſide of Religion, and that their principal deſign was, to fill their Readers, with Confidence, Hope and Joy. Without doubt it is a laudable and pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to uſe ones endeavours to Comfort the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and particularly good Men; and I confeſs that we find in the Books which have been compoſed with that view, many edifying things and noble Sentiments of Piety; but for all that, thoſe Books may eaſily inſpire Men with ſecurity, when the Conſolations which they diſpenſe, are not attended with great Circumſpection and Prudence.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh that all thoſe who have publiſhed Books of this kind, had well conſidered theſe two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Truths. The firſt is, that the Comforts which Religion affords, belong only to true Chriſtians; ſo that it is an eſſential part of the Duty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, carefully to diſtinguiſh Perſons, and to mark clearly who thoſe are that have aright to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:96537:248"/>Comforts. The Second is, that it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Sanctifie, as it is to Comfort Men; Nay, That the Sanctifying them is the more neceſſary of the two, becauſe Holineſs is more eſſential to a good Man, than Conſolation and Joy; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men are much more inclined to preſume than to condemn themſelves; beſides that there are but few who want Comfort, in compariſon with thoſe who ought to be te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tified.</p>
                  <p>The Conſolations of which the Books of Piety are full, are intended either for Afflicted Perſons or for Sinners. As for the firſt, it is better to teach them how to make a good life of their Afflictions, and to bring them to examine and amend their Lives, than to diſcourſe to them upon ſome general Topick of Comfort, which perhaps will only lay them faſter aſleep in ſecurity, and which is beſides generally miſapplied. For all that the Goſpel ſays of Afflictions is commonly laid together, and that too with no great Judgment; and what is ſaid on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Afflictions of the Faithful who ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake, is applied to the Afflictions which are common to all Mankind. It is much more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to teach Men how to die well, than to fortify them againſt the fear of Death; Nay, we cannot give them a more ſubſtantial Comfort, than if we perſuade them to live well, ſince a good Life will moſt certainly bring them to a happy Death.</p>
                  <p>But we ought to be particularly cautious when we comfort Sinners, and give them aſſurances of the Divine Mercy; for if this is not done with great circumſpection, we may eaſily harden and ruin at the ſame time, that we are comforting them. This is the miſchief of thoſe Books, which ſpeak but little of Repentance and inſiſt much upon Confidence, whoſe only deſign it is to encourage the greateſt Sinners, and to exhort them to a bold reliance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Mercy, without fearing either the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:96537:248"/>or the Multitude of their Sins. Such Conſolations are capable of a good Senſe; but if they are not propoſed with due explication and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, vaſt numbers of People will abuſe them. That which has been writ by ſome Authors in Books of Devotion, concerning Sin and Good Works, is apt to lead Men into this fancy, That good Works ſignify nothing in order to Salvation, and that Sin does not obſtruct it. Under pretenſe of anſwering the Accuſations of the Devil and of the Law, theſe Authors enervate the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the neceſſity of Good Works, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Declarations of Scripture concerning San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and they deſtroy as much as in them lies, the Sincerity and Truth of the Precepts and threatnings of the Goſpel. For what they call the Accuſations of the Devil and of the Law, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nothing elſe but the juſt apprehenſions of a guilty Conſcience which are inſpired by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and which ſhould be cheriſhed and fortified to bring Sinners to Repentance, inſtead of being removed by ill diſpenſed Conſolations.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid to this, that Sinners are not to be driven to Deſpair. But do we make Sinners deſperate, by ſaying that they are not in a State of Salvation, when really they are not? Do we not comfort them enough, when we exhort them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God's Mercy and to repent? What if we ſhould by unſeaſonable Conſolations, fill them with a vain and groundleſs Confidence; would not that ſecurity ruin them more certainly than Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? To make Men fearleſs is the ready way to undo them. After all, I cannot imagine, why Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould talk ſo much of Deſpair, and ſeem ſo hugely afraid of it. By the endeavours uſed in Books and Sermons to keep Sinners from it, one would think that we had great reaſon to fear on that hand, and that nothing were more ordinary
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:96537:249"/>than for Men to deſpair of the Divine Mercy; and yet there is nothing more unuſual. For one Sinner who is terrified with his Sins, thouſands are undone by Security. It is remarkable than the Scripture ſpeaks but ſeldom of Deſpair, and when we have well examined all the places which are thought to mention it, we ſhall not find many that ſpeak poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of it. Many Church-men who have Cure of Souls, confeſs that they never ſaw any Perſon afflicted with Deſpair. And as for the Inſtances which are alledged to this purpoſe, it is certain that what is called Deſperation is commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Fit of the Spleen and an effect of Grief and Melancholy. So that thoſe who make long Diſcourſes to prevent Sinners falling into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, take great pains to little purpoſe, and do for the moſt part fight with a ſhadow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is another Fault in ſome Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion quite contrary to this I have now obſerved, which is, that they terrify their Readers without reaſon. If Authors, otherwiſe Pious and Learned, had not ſpoken in their Writings of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, of Reprobation, Deſpair, the Power of the Devil, and of ſome other Matters, many People would have been free from thoſe terrible Frights which the indiſcreet handling of thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did throw them into. The reading of ſuch Books has occaſioned, and does ſtill produce great Miſchiefs, when they are read by Men of weak Heads, that are inclined to Melancholy; and the Number of ſuch Perſons is very conſiderable. Some have fancied they had committed the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and being poſſeſſed with that diſmal Thought, they have ſpent their Lives in dreadful. Apprehenſions, of which nothing could cure them. Others have imagined, that their Caſe cure them. Others have imagined, that their Caſe was deſperate, and that they were in a State of Reprobation, and Damnation. Others have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:96537:249"/>that they were given up to the Power of Satan; and they have taken the Diſorders of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for certain Signs of their being poſſeſſed with an Evil Spirit: And the worſt of it is, that ſuch indiſcreet Diſcourſes are more apt to alarm good, than wicked Men. In fine, I reckon among the Books which fright Men without Cauſe, all thoſe which contain too rigid and auſtere Maxims of Devotion and Morality.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Piety would be better known, and more eſteemed than it is, if Books of Devotion were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways writ with Judgment, and Good Senſe; and if there was nothing in them, but what, upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Examination, would appear to be ſtrictly true. Thoſe who ſet about Works of this nature, do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally make it their Buſineſs to move the Heart, and to excite Sentiments of Piety. This is a good Deſign; but we ought to know, that it is the Force of Reaſons, the Evidence of Proofs, the Greatneſs; of the Objects propoſed, and the Clearneſs and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of what a Man ſays, which does truly affect the Heart. This is what Judicious Authors chiefly mind; and thereby many have had good Succeſs in thoſe excellent Works which they have enriched the Publick with. But other Writers do not conſider this; they rather chooſe to ſay tender and patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Things, than to think, or ſpeak, with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: They conſult Imagination more than Good Senſe, they pour out every thing, which is in the Heat of Meditation, or in the Fervency of their Zeal, ſeems to them proper to move, to melt, to comfort, or to terrifie. Hence it is, that there are weak places in their Books and Thoughts; which appear mean, and even falſe, to diſcerning Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Contradictions, and ſuch like Defects: For on the one hand, they produce only a confuſed, and not a very rational Devotion, in thoſe who read and reliſh them: And on the other hand, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:96537:250"/>Religion to the Flouts, and Contempt, of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines. We are often troubled, and ſcandalized, to find, that ſome Men of Parts expreſs but little Eſteem for Books of Piety: We hear it ſaid every Day, that thoſe Books are only good for Women, and for the Vulgar. This Contempt chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a profane Humour, and from Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; but it ſprings likewiſe from the want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and Solidity, which is obſervable in ſome Books of Devotion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Divers Conſiderations might be offered here about thoſe Books which contain Forms of Prayers and Devotion; but I ſhall confine my ſelf to theſe two, which appear to me the moſt material. The firſt is, that thoſe kind of Forms, make all ſorts of Perſons indifferently, and even good Men ſay things, which cannot agree, but to the greateſt and the moſt notorious Sinners; which gives People this dangerous Notion, That all Men, without except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Regenerate, are extreamly corrupt. In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prayers we plainly ſee, that thoſe who compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, had no other Deſign, than to draw the Picture of the moſt heinous Sinners, and that they ſuppoſed all Men engaged in a deep Corruption, and in the moſt criminal Diſorders. Exaggerations, and Hyperboles, are ſo little ſpared by ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon this Head, that they utter Abſurdities and Falſhoods in their Prayers; as when they ſay, That ever ſince we were born, we have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and every moment, offending God, by Thoughts, Words, and Deeds.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny, but that ſuch Prayers may have their uſe, provided nothing be ſaid in them that is extravagant, or contrary to Truth and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe; they fit great Numbers of Perſons: There are but too many of thoſe wretched Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who can never ſufficiently bewail the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their Sins, and the Irregularities of their
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:96537:250"/>Conduct. I know beſides, that all Men are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that the beſt of them have Reaſon to humble and abaſe themſelves in the ſight of God, out of a ſenſe of their own weakneſs and unworthineſs. Nevertheleſs, ſince the Scripture makes a difference between Good and Bad Men, it is at leaſt a great piece of Imprudence, to appoint the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage for both, and to make them all ſpeak as if they were guilty of the moſt horrid Crimes, and as if there was not one good Man in the World. This takes away the Diſtinction between the Sinners and the Righteous; for if theſe Prayers are proper for all ſorts of Perſons, if all that is ſaid in them is true, it is a vain thing to diſtinguiſh a good Man from a bad; and, it is to no purpoſe to pray to God for his Converting Grace, or to make any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Amendment to him: All thoſe Leſſons of Holineſs which the Goſpel gives us, are but fine Idea's; all Men are upon the matter equally bad, and they may all be the Objects of God's Mercy, how irregular ſoever their Deportment may be. Theſe are the Inferences which may be drawn from thoſe Forms of Devotion I have mentioned, and which Sinners do actually draw from them. From all this, I conclude, that in ſuch Works it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſtinguiſh <hi>Perſons</hi> and Conditions: And this accordingly has been judiciouſly obſerved by ſome Authors.</p>
                  <p>The other Conſideration relates to the Form of Prayers; theſe are not always plain enough. They are ſometimes ſtudied Diſcourſes, which have more of Art and Wit than of Affection in them. And we may eaſily diſcern how far moſt Prayers are re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moved from a due Simplicity, if we compare them with thoſe which are contained in Holy Scripture, or with the ancient Way of Praying which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, and of which we may judge by the <hi>Liturgies</hi> which are now uſed, or which
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:96537:251"/>have reached to us. Prayers were neither ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate then, nor ſo long as they are now. Long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles were not uſed in the beginning of Prayers, and Men did not them by ſo many Windings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Throne of Grace, to confeſs their Sins, and to beg Pardon for them. Prayers then were ſhort, ſimple and natural, much fitted to excite Devotion, to lift up the Heart to God, and to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Piety and Zeal, than many Forms which obtain at this day.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Of all the Books of Piety, none are more carefully read; and none perhaps have a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Conduct and Manners of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than the Books of Preparation for the Holy Communion. The uſe of the Sacrament is one of the moſt important Acts of Religion, and one of the moſt efficacious Means to promote Piety; and it is certain that the Books which People read, in order to prepare themſelves for that ſacred Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contribute very much to the good or bad uſe of the Euchariſt, and by Conſequence to the good or ill Life of Chriſtians, Now what I have ſaid of the other Books of Devotion may be applied to theſe. Some Books of this kind are extraordinary good, but there are others, in which among many good things ſome Defects are obſervable, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the Books of Preparation for the Holy Communion, are not inſtructive and ſolid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. We find nothing elſe in ſome of them, but a heap of Thoughts, which have no dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, of Rhetorical Figures, Allegories, and Compariſons fetched from the Old Teſtament, or from prophane Hiſtory. Theſe things may have their Uſe, they may be place in a Sermon: But not to ſay that ſometimes, thoſe Thoughts and Compariſons are not very appoſite or ſuitable to the Subject; I ſhall only obſerve, that ſomething
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:96537:251"/>more than this is neceſſary, to ſtir up Devotion in the Communicants. I do but juſt name this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have delivered my Opinion more at large concerning this Defect, in my three Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Books of Morality, and in the 5th upon Books of Devotion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other Books of Preparation are too general. They only conſider in the lump the Duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in reference to the Communion; they ſpeak of Self-Examination, Repentance, Faith and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But all this is of no great uſe to many groſs and ignorant Chriſtians, who neither know thoſe Duties, nor how they ought to be performed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all thoſe who come to the Sacrament are not in the ſame Condition, ſome being good Men, and others impious and hypocritical Perſons. There are likewiſe ſeveral degrees of good Men as well as of Hypocrites and ungodly Perſons, and the ſame Man may be better or worſe at one time than he is at another. Therefore it would be fitting that Books of Preparation, were compoſed in ſuch a manner, that every Reader may be led by them, into thoſe Reflections which are ſuitable to the State he is in. It is a groſs Error to imagine, that a general Preparation or Diſcourſe concerning the receiving of the Sacrament, is proper for all ſorts of Perſons. I confeſs that this is not the Fault of all the Books of Preparation, ſome we have, which are particular enough. The true Characters by which every Man may know his own State, are very exactly deſcribed by ſome Authors; but it is an unhappineſs that ſuch Works, are not better calculated for the uſe of the common People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I think I may ſafely ſay in the third place, that the too ſevere Notion which ſome Books give of the Communion, is one of the Cauſes, why ſo many People do neither live, nor receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they ought. It is a ſad thing that the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:96537:252"/>Minds of Chriſtians ſhould be filled with ſo many Scruples in relation to the Sacrament, by inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſcourſes and over-ſtrained Maxims; Writers and Preachers do ſometimes ſpeak of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as if every thing in it was full of Snares, and as if Hell and Damnation, were conſtantly waiting about it. They repreſent the Communion, as ſo extraordinary, ſo difficult and ſo dangerous an Action, that thoſe who read or hear thoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are tempted to keep off from the Holy Table, and deſpair of partaking of it as they ought. So that whereas there ſhould be nothing but Joy, when the Euchariſt is celebrated in the Church, many are then agitated with extream Perplexities and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
                  <p>By this indiſcreet Severity it happens, that many good Men receive the Sacrament without Comfort; becauſe their Conſciences are diſturbed with divers Scruples, which proceed from the reading of thoſe Books. There is a great number of pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who never receive the Sacrament but with ſtrange apprehenſion and dread, in ſo much that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral think they receive it to their Condemnation. Nay this diſcourages likewiſe many Sinners who have ſome inclination to Good, and ſome deſire to ſet about the Work of Repentance. Indeed we muſt take heed not to flatter Sinners in their Vices, nor to propoſe to them too eaſie a Devotion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It is very fit in my Judgment, to give them a great Idea of the Purity which is required in ſo Holy and Solemn an Action as the Communion is, and of the State which a Chriſtian ought then to be in. But as this State of Purity and Holineſs is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by degrees; that Idea, how true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, is apt to fright a Sinner, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Converſion, becauſe he does not find in himſelf at firſt, all the Characters of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſincere Regeneration. He ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:96537:252"/>to be informed, that the beginnings of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are weak, that it has its Degrees and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and ſo that he ought not to be diſheartened; that God will accept of his Devotion and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, provided his Repentance increaſe afterwards and he forſake his Sins honeſtly. The Matter is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done in point of Devotion and Morality, not only when we propoſe Rules which are too rigid, but alſo when we ſay things, which tho' true and conſonant to the Goſpel, are not ſufficiently acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the State of thoſe we ſpeak to.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal Reflections I thought fit to beſtow, both upon Books of Religion and upon bad Books. All that remains now is to enquire, what Remedies are to be applied to the Cauſe of Corruption. The ſureſt of all would be to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all the ill Books, and to take care that none ſuch ſhould be made for the time to come. But as this is not to be hoped, the only Remedy which can be tried, is on the one hand, to prevent as much as we can the Effect of bad Books, and on the other, to engage Men to read and to make a good uſe of good Books.</p>
                  <p>The Books which are contrary to Religion and good Manners may eaſily be known; but how to keep Men from reading and being corrupted by them is the Difficulty: And in all probability this is a Point which will never be entirely gained. Yet I think it is not impoſſible to prevent in ſome meaſure the Miſchief which thoſe Books occaſion in the World. In order to this it would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to take care in the firſt place, that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not read Books which inſpire Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. To this end, the Authors who have writ things repugnant to Modeſty and Honeſty, ſhould be expelled the Schools. It is a ſurprizing thing that the Eccleſiaſticks, who have the direction of Academies and Colleges, and who are bound by
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:96537:253"/>their Character to redreſs this Abuſe, have not done it yet. In the next place it would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that in Families, Books which are apt to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Youth ſhould be taken out of their way, and that they ſhould not be indulged in dangerous Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. As for the reſt I ſee no other Remedy, but that Preachers ſhould ſtrongly inſiſt in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, upon the Reaſons which ought to make Chriſtians averſe to the reading of ill Books. I I know that all theſe precautions, will not wholly ſuppreſs thoſe Books, nor prevent their being read by divers Perſons; but we may however gain thus much, that ill Books ſhall not be ſo freely and ſo commonly read as they are, and that they ſhall do leſs hurt.</p>
                  <p>As for Books of Religion, every one ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcern thoſe which are good, and to make a good uſe of them. Indeed the diſcerning and the Choice of Books of Religion, is attended with ſome difficulty. The general Rule is to chuſe thoſe which are inſtructive and edifying. Every body will own this to be a good Rule, but all Men do not agree in the Application of it. What ſeems edifying to ſome, appears quite otherwiſe to others. In point of Religion all Men ſhould be of the ſame Mind, ſince they are all bound to believe the ſame Truths, and practiſe the ſame Duties, but their Taſtes are different, becauſe many of them have a vitiated Palate.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak my Mind upon this Subject, I think that Chriſtians ſhould chiefly ſtick to thoſe Books, which prove the Truths of Religion, and which eſtabliſh by ſolid Arguments the fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian Faith, and to thoſe which give a clear and exact View of the Duties of Morality: To theſe it may be uſeful to add the Works, in which we find the Examples of Perſons eminent for their Piety and Virtue. Such Examples are very
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:96537:253"/>efficacious to excite Men to the Practice of what is good, and they prove a great Preſervative againſt the Scandal occaſioned by bad Example, and againſt the Corruption of the Age. But not to enlarge further upon the Choice of Books, I refer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to what has been ſaid in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>A judicious Choice of Books being once made, the next thing is to make a good uſe of them. And here two Rules are to be obſerved. 1. A Man ſhould read with Judgment; And 2. he ſhould read in order to Practice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Book ſoever we read, it is abſolutely neceſſary to read it with Diſcretion and Judgment. We are commanded in Scripture,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Theſ. V. XXI. 1 Joh. IV. I.</note> 
                     <hi>To prove all things and to hold faſt that which is good; to try the Spirits and the Doctrines whether they are of God.</hi> This Caution is to be uſed leſt we fall into Errors, ſince every Author is a Man, and by conſequence may ſometimes be miſtaken. The common People do particularly need this Advice, becauſe they are very apt to believe, that whatſoever is read in Books, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in Books of Devotion, is true. But tho' a Book ſhould contain nothing but what is good; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is neceſſary to make a juſt Application of the Contents of it to out ſelves, becauſe that which is proper for ſome is not ſutable to others. The not obſerving this Rule is the Reaſon why ſome Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have a pure, but a timorous and ſhort-ſighted Conſcience, are terrified without Cauſe, and apply to themſelves what is ſaid only of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, when on the other hand, hardened Sinners deceive themſelves with vain hopes, by adapting to themſelves, what related only to good Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ought to read, in order to practice, and that we may grow better; this is the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Rule of the two, and that which diſtinguiſhes true from hypocritical Devotion. Many are very regular and conſtant in Reading, and they ſeldom
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:96537:254"/>fail to do it Mornings and Evenings: But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of thoſe Perſons who are ſo aſſiduous in the peruſing of good Books, is not always agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Rules of Devotion and Piety. When they are but juſt come from their Reading, we find them often ſowr, peeviſh, and paſſionate; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have read in the Morning, they ſpend the Day in Slandering, Gaming, or Idleneſs, and they avoid only the groſſer, and the more noiſie Sins. There are Readers of another Character; they read, and even delight in the Reading of Books of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: They like well enough thoſe Works which prove the Truths of the Chriſtian Religion, or treat of Morals; they ſpeak of them advantagiouſly, and they will ſay fine Things concerning the Abuſes which are crept into Religion, and upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and the Beauty of Morals; but all this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates only in a vain and fruitleſs Approbation, which they give to the Truths and Duties of the Goſpel; for after all, they reform nothing in their Lives: Such Readings are but meer Amuſements, and they are good for nothing but to rock Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into a moſt dangerous Sleep. The End of Reading, as well as that of all Religion, ought to be the Practice of Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>I. ſhall here obſerve, laſt of all, that Chriſtians have a Book, which alone might ſuffice to preſerve them from the Danger of ill Books, and to ſecure them againſt the Corruption of the Age, if they did uſe it as they ought; I mean the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: It is the beſt of all Books, a Work divinely inſpired, which contains nothing but what is moſt excellent and true, and wherein we find every thing that is neceſſary to inſtruct, and to ſanctifie Men. But it were to be wiſhed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Tranſlations of Scripture, which are in the hands of the People, ſhould be rendered more perfect, ſo that they might expreſs the Senſe
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:96537:254"/>of Sacred Authors with all poſſible Exactneſs. All thoſe who have ſtudied the Original Text of the Bible, will own, that this is a neceſſary Work, and that the Tranſlations need ſome Amendments. And ſo we ſee accordingly, that now and then, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Tranſlators, apply themſelves to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It would be to no purpoſe to have exact Tranſlations of Scripture, if Men could not read it: I have already remarked it elſewhere, as a crying and ſhameful Abuſe, that a great part of Chriſtians ſhould not be able to read. This Abuſe ſhould have been reformed long ago; and this might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done, if every Paſtor did endeavour it in his own Church, and if the Magiſtrates did lend a helping Hand toward it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Holy Scripture ſhould be read more than it is, and Men ſhould make that uſe of it for which it was given. Other Books are only Streams, but when we read the Scripture, we drink at the very Fountain-head. Humane Books have their Faults, and therefore they ought to be read with great Diſcretion: But this Divine Book is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is a Guide to whoſe Conduct we may give up our ſelves without fear or danger: This being certain, is it not ſtrange that the beſt of all Books ſhould be the moſt neglected? In many Countries the Bible is a Book unknown to the People. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places the reading of it is permitted but with great Cautions, as if it were dangerous for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to reveal a Book, by which God was pleaſed to reveal his Will to Men. In thoſe places where Chriſtians have an entire Liberty to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, great multitudes make no advantage of that freedom. Many that are addicted to reading leave the Word of God for other Books. In a word, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few read it with ſuitable Diſpoſitions, and with a ſincere Deſign of learning the Will of God and of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96537:255"/>growing the better by it. And thus the far greater part of Mankind, is deſtitute of the moſt efficacious mean and remedy, which the Divine Goodneſs has afforded to Men, to preſerve them from the Contagion of Sin, and to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. And ſo we need not wonder that the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians ſhould be ſuch, as it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in this Work.</p>

                  <head>The Concluſion of this Treatiſe</head>
                  <p>THis is what I had propoſed to ſay concerning the Cauſes of Corruption. I might have been larger upon theſe Matters, and have added many things which I have not touched. This is a very copious Field, and a Subject which can hardly be exhauſted, yet I think I have obſerved what is moſt material.</p>
                  <p>But it will be to little purpoſe to have detected the Cauſes of Corruption, if thoſe Cauſe do ſtill ſubſiſt; and therefore I conclude this Work with an earneſt entreaty to my Readers, that they will make ſerious Reflections upon it, and that if they find that in Fact, Corruption proceeds from thoſe Cauſes I have mentioned, they wil ſtrive to remove them. The Undertaking will no doubt, appear very difficult to many. They will own the Truth of what I have ſaid, but they will look upon the deſign of oppoſing the Corruption of the Age, as vain and chimerical. They will ſay that all this is very fine in the Theory, but that the Practice of it is impoſſible. I confeſs here is ſome difficulty, but yet I am perſuaded, that what I have propoſed might ſucceſsfully be done, at leaſt in ſome reſpects.</p>
                  <p>But the general Cauſes of Corruption can ſcarce be remedied but by publick Perſons. I therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf here particularly to Divines and to the Paſtors of the Church, and I conjure them to make it their ſerious Buſineſs, to diſcover and to ſtop the Springs of Corruption. Let them turn all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:96537:255"/>that way; let them labour to diſpel the Ignorance and Prejudices which ſo many Chriſtians live in, and to confute thoſe Maxims and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which feed Security and Libertiniſm; let them preſs with Zeal the reſtoring of Order and Diſciplines; let them inceſſantly lay before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Magiſtrates, the neceſſity of redreſſing ſeveral Abuſes which are now in vogue; let them inculcate theſe things and inſiſt upon them with Zeal, but at the ſame time with Prudence and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; let them concert Meaſures among themſelves. let them act unanimouſly in ſo noble a Deſign. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things let them take care to ſeaſon young People with good Inſtruction, and to inſpire them with Sentiments of Religion and Vertue. Theſe are the Solicitudes which become the Miniſters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Theſe are Enterprizes worthy of their Character and their Zeal, and the things which ought chiefly to be conſidered in the Aſſemblies of the Clergy. But let them not be diſcouraged by the Difficulties they are like to meet with. They will ſtill gain ſomething, even when they may fancy they labour in vain. If they do not obtain all that they deſire, if they do not cure the whole Evil, they will remove at leaſt ſome part of it. So holy an Enterprize will ſooner or later be fortunate in the Iſſue, and God will pour down a Bleſſing upon thoſe Means, which he himſelf has appointed.</p>
                  <p>One would think that Providence is at work to bring about happier Times, and that things are tending that way. This is an Age of Knowledge, and Religion is now better proved and explained, than ever it was. There is a conſiderable number of judicious and learned Divines, and Paſtors, who are deeply grieved to ſee the preſent Face of things, and who are ſenſible how neceſſary it would be to oppoſe Corruption. So many Books which are writ on purpoſe, to revive true Chriſtianity, and
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96537:256"/>to bring Men to Holineſs, ſeem to bode ſome bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Revolution, and to argue a general Diſpoſition towards it. God who preſides over all things, and particularly over that which concerns Religion, bleſs the Deſigns and Endeavours of all thoſe, who have good Intentions, and grant that we may quickly ſee Truth, Piety, Peace and Order, intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored among Chriſtians.</p>
